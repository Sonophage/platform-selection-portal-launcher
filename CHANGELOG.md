## [Unreleased]

## [1.8.0] - 2026-09-24

### Added
- **Start opens the notification panel.** The button was already bound — it confirms inside the
  pickers — and on the crossbar it did nothing at all. BACK closes the sheet, which it also could
  not do before: the sheet was local state the input handler knew nothing about, so BACK went past
  it and opened the App Drawer with the sheet still on screen.

- **A media row across the top of the sheet.** One row with two tenants: the playing track with
  its position and a transport, or — when nothing is playing — the last game you were in, with
  Resume. It shows a PAUSED track, unlike the strip's live slot above it, which is about what is
  happening right now; a paused track is precisely what you open a transport for. The game's row
  draws no progress bar, because "last played" knows no position and a bar at zero would be a
  claim rather than an absence.

- **The device's notifications can be opened and cleared.** Confirm opens the app that posted one,
  Y clears it, and both are offered only where they work: a notification with no content intent
  has nowhere to go, and an ongoing one — a media session, a foreground service — cannot be
  cleared at all. The cursor never stops on the launcher's own column, whose rows are reports of
  finished work with nothing to do to them.

- **Action pills under the focused row.** Details, Favorite, Open with and Collection on a game;
  Launch, Edit, Favorite and Collection on an app. They are always there rather than opening on a
  press, and nothing moves when one is used. Left and right walk into the row — right lands on the
  first pill, left on the last — and walking off the far end leaves the row and steps the category
  in the same press, because a row with no other way in would otherwise be re-entered by the very
  next press and make the crossbar unreachable. A pill carries no handler of its own: it is an id
  the row's own menu already dispatches, so a pill and the menu row with the same name cannot
  drift apart. On the Recent shelf the pills take no left or right at all, since stepping off the
  shelf is that screen's main gesture and four pills in front of it turn one press into five.

- **A fan of the newest covers beside the focused card.** It answers "what is actually in here"
  for a row whose label can only say "7 games". It costs no query — the category list already
  holds every game to compute those counts. "Newest" is highest id first, a proxy for a
  date-added column the schema does not have, so a library rebuild reorders the fan.

- **A 2x2 art grid on cards, four covers from inside.** Emulation and the media columns both.
  Fewer than four fills what there is and leaves the rest empty, so a two-game card reads as a
  part-filled shelf rather than as a card that only ever had two. Each media row takes a different
  four, offset by four down the same library, so Artists, Albums and Playlists do not all show the
  same handful. A row that IS one thing — the playing track, the video you stopped — keeps its own
  art instead.

- **Scrubbers on the playing track and the video you stopped.** A progress line under Now
  Playing's meta and across the resume row's thumbnail, only while there is something to report.
  The bar reads the live playback value rather than the one baked in when the column was built,
  and only the bar recomposes — rebuilding a four-row list twice a second to move three pixels is
  the wrong trade.

- **The Library column leads with the book you are reading.** Continue reading, the cover, and
  when you last opened it. Books had no counterpart to Now Playing and Resume, so opening one
  changed nothing on the screen you came back to. The page number is still not knowable; the rest
  of the row never depended on it.

- **Add to Cross Bar, on the app drawer's menu.** The drawer names the app and the XMB knows which
  column is open behind it, so the destination is decided out there and written with the same call
  the column's own "Add Apps" picker makes. Three columns never read their assigned apps — a
  gaming category builds from the games table, Settings builds its own hierarchy, and Last Played
  is derived from `last_played_at` — so sending an app to one of those refuses out loud rather
  than writing a row that appears on no screen.

- **Android's own notifications, and a sheet to pull them down.** A `NotificationListenerService`
  reads what the rest of the device is saying. The status strip's corner carries one count for
  both kinds, because it is a count of what that press opens, and the sheet shows two columns:
  the device's on the left, the launcher's on the right. Not interleaved — the launcher's are
  events that happened and are done, the system's are ongoing and stay until something dismisses
  them, and one list sorted by time is a list where half the rows can be acted on and half can
  only be read. Nothing is stored; every callback republishes the whole active set.

- **A bottom bar that names what the button acts on.** Full width, the page's footer rather than a
  pill lying on it: `Ⓑ Apps │ Ⓐ Open All Games … Ⓧ Sort Ⓨ Options Ⓢ Search`. Back leads it, because
  the button that gets you out of somewhere should be findable without reading and sits in the same
  place on every screen, while the primary's label changes with every row the cursor touches. Back
  is named after what it does — at the crossbar root it opens the app drawer, so it says "Apps".
  With the context rail open the bar reads Select and Close and the right half is empty, since
  everything it would offer is already in the rail.

- **Keyboard and Touch join Xbox, Nintendo and PlayStation** in Settings ▸ Controller. The prompts
  name actions and resolve the button from the same mappings the input handler reads, so a footer
  cannot disagree with the pad.

- **Type to search.** Any printable character on the XMB opens Search carrying it. On a handheld
  with a hardwired keyboard, reaching for a bound key first is a press that says nothing. The
  gamepad handler runs first, so the six bound keys are never read as text.

- **A warm bloom behind whatever the cursor is on.** The XMB had no focus glow at all — size and
  alpha were the only cues, and the distance ramp below weakened the second one. Five stops on a
  roughly gaussian falloff, so there is no radius at which the glow stops; the first version held
  80% of its alpha to mid-radius and drew a visible disc. Reach is a fraction of the icon rather
  than a dp, because icon size is a user setting and a dp bloom would be a ring at one setting and
  a smudge at another. The design's 4px white ring is not here: there is no single tile shape to
  wrap while the leading slot holds a dozen different item types.

- **Fade By Distance**, in Appearance. Unselected slots dim by how far they sit from the cursor,
  along the crossbar and down the item column, off one ramp. It replaces "Solid Unfocused Icons",
  which asked a different question — that one asked whether to dim at all, this one asks flat or
  by distance — so it is a new preference key rather than a rename. Reusing the key would have
  turned "I did not want dimming" into "I want the ramp" on every device that had ever touched it.

- **The disc comes out of a case, and leaves through a drive slot.** The case appears alone, slides
  left, and the disc rolls out from behind it on an arc; the disc now drops through the bottom of
  the frame rather than fading, and a bar of light closes to a point exactly as the game takes the
  screen.

### Changed
- **The options rail no longer takes A away from the game.** It opened with its first row already
  picked, which moved confirm from "play this" to "run whatever the first action happens to be".
  Nothing is picked until you move onto something; the first press enters from the end it came
  from, so DOWN lands on the top row and UP on the bottom. Confirm with nothing picked plays the
  game.

- **Play is gone from the game menu**, because confirm does it on every surface now. The entry
  remains, hidden, so it stays the one definition of what Play does — confirm runs that row rather
  than a second path to the same verb.

- **The pill row under a game has a way in that does not cost a press.** DOWN at the bottom of a
  column enters it, where the press has always done nothing, and UP gives the row back. LEFT no
  longer enters it: on a drilled-in list LEFT is spent backing out of the folder, so the mirror
  the code claimed to offer never existed there. Once the cursor is in the row, left and right are
  the row's and nothing else's — before, LEFT from inside the row left the folder as well.

- **The launcher is set in Instrument Sans.** SIL Open Font License like Inter, one variable file,
  190 KB against Inter's 876 KB. Its weight axis floors at 400 where Inter's ran to 100, so eleven
  call sites that ask for Light now render at 400 — the context menus, the wizard scaffold and its
  splash, the boot sequence, the colour-scheme picker, the music browser and the track picker. That
  is deliberate: the design imports the family at 400/500/600/700, and the alternative is a second
  font file for one weight nothing asked for. The Credits screen names the new family and authors.

- **The launch ceremony runs to a 6.85-second hand-off**, up from 4.5. The time went on the spin
  and then on the opening, not on the phases that are movements with a destination — lengthening
  those makes the disc look slow rather than the ceremony look long.

- **A game row says its system and when you last played it** — "Game Boy Advance · Today, 1:49 PM"
  — falling back to the publisher for a game never started, and to the bare system name when there
  is neither. It replaces "Platform (Emulator)", which was the same string on every row of a
  console's column. The emulator name is still on the game's detail screen, where it is a question
  someone actually asks.

- **A game keeps its name until you open the hover strip.** Landing on a row used to print the
  title for about 650ms and then fade the logo in over it and take the name away — which is where
  the meta line above was going. The crossbar now shows the row's title and meta line at rest and
  draws no panel; the logo is a page you reach. Whichever shoulder is pressed first opens the strip
  on the logo page rather than stepping off it, L1 from there returns to rest, and the label clears
  the moment any page opens, which is what stopped a long title printing through its own wordmark.
  On the logo page the focused row's subtitle becomes what the thing IS — "2000 · Platform ·
  Digital Eclipse · 1-2 players" — and falls back to the ordinary line for a game with nothing
  scraped. Emulation only; the Recent shelf is untouched.

- **The app drawer is eight across with the search box always on the header.** The field used to
  appear only while search was active, which made the drawer a screen you had to know had a search
  in it; the field and the keyboard are now two things, so a d-pad press or a tap can put the
  keyboard away while the query you typed stays on screen.

- **Every drawer tab shows what it holds, and everything else beneath it.** The tab's own apps as
  one large row, every app it does not hold as a compact A–Z list under it. The two halves come
  from one filter and its negation, so a tab cannot show an app twice or lose one between them.
  **All Apps is gone** with the grid that was drawn for it — four sections left: Recently Used,
  Apps, Emulators, Games. Nothing became unreachable, since every tab already listed the rest.

- **All fourteen context menus are a rail up the right edge.** Actions stack as rounded-square
  badges against the edge; the focused one grows leftward into a white capsule carrying its name,
  and the unfocused ones keep their names faded by the same distance ramp the crossbar uses. Only
  the drawing and the length changed — same builders, same handlers, same cursor. Two rules decide
  the length: the four ids already on the pill row are dropped, and the rest cap at nine. There is
  no "More", so what falls past the cap is not reachable from the rail; destructive rows sort last
  in every builder and are never what gets cut. The scrim is measured off the rail's own width and
  capped at 62% of the screen, and it is full screen with the status strip and bottom bar drawn on
  top of it rather than stopping short of them and leaving a seam.

- **The header pulls apart.** Live activity on the left — art tile, title and a detail line, which
  in practice means music, the only live activity this app has. The clock on the right with the
  battery drawn as a hairline across the very top edge of the screen, full bleed, filled to the
  charge and shimmering on the charger; a line that stops short of the corners reads as a widget.
  The centre carries navigation hints when nothing else claims it, and the shelf's media filter
  still wins that slot, because which cut of the shelf you are on is state and state beats a hint.
  Status icons are now exactly the font's height — they had been 13dp beside 8sp text.

- **The toast pill is gone.** It appeared top centre, said its piece for three seconds and left, so
  anything you were not looking at you never saw. The newest report takes the status strip's live
  slot for the same dwell, and pressing that corner pulls the rest down as a sheet. The history is
  in memory only, capped at twelve — a notification that survived a restart would be reporting on
  a world that no longer exists.

- **Last Played has no slot on the category bar.** It is not a column, it replaces the whole
  screen, so that icon was one you could never see selected. LEFT off Emulation still reaches it,
  and it is hidden from the bar rather than removed from the model. The slot comes back whenever
  the last input was a finger, because a finger has no equivalent of stepping left off Emulation,
  and goes again on the next button press.

- **The Recent strip shows the filter you are on, not all five**, and "Sort: Title" is now "Title".
  Both took the whole centre of the strip to name a control rather than its value, next to a clock
  that does not say "Time:". X still cycles the filter.

- **The default category order is the one on a real device**, read out of the owner's database
  rather than guessed: Last Played, Emulation, Music, Video, Photo, Library, Network, then Settings
  with room before it for a category you make.

- **The shelf's launch control is a rail row.** It was a vertical shimmering bar down the right
  edge with its own widget and its own metrics; it is now the same white capsule and rounded-square
  badge the context rail draws, from the same file. The shimmer went with it — a solid white
  capsule does not need the help.

- **The controller glyphs are real art** — Xelu's Free Controller & Keyboard Prompts, CC0 —
  replacing a white silhouette set under hand-picked tints. An Xbox button is grey with a coloured
  letter, and the PlayStation set is the DualShock 4 on purpose: a DualSense prints its symbols in
  white, so accurate PS5 art has no colour in it at all. Keycaps draw at exactly the height of the
  glyph beside them, and Touch's directions are arrows rather than the words "Swipe left".

### Fixed
- **The crossbar launched games on the wrong emulator.** "Change Emulator" wrote the choice and
  the launch never read it. With direct launch on — the path confirm takes — the XMB picked the
  first available emulator for the platform, which is the bottom rung of the resolution ladder on
  its own, so a per-game override, a Memory Card's emulator and a per-system default were all
  written by their menus and ignored. Game Detail's Play obeyed all three, so the same game
  launched on two different emulators depending on how you started it. Its refusal was wrong in
  the same way: it named a setting that path never consulted.

- **Every action pill ran the wrong thing.** Details opened Manage Collections; Favorite and Open
  with each opened a submenu. A pill found its menu entry by position in one list and ran it by
  position in another — the rail's list, which is built by removing exactly the pills — so the
  press always landed on a real action and never the right one. Actions are dispatched by id now.

- **Nothing in the notification sheet could be pressed.** The full-screen press-catcher that
  closes it was drawn on top of the sheet rather than under it, so every tap meant for a card or
  a transport control closed the sheet instead.

- **Opening a notification did nothing.** The intent fired and Android refused it — a launcher
  sending another app's notification intent has to opt in to the activity start explicitly since
  Android 14, even though it has a visible window and would otherwise be allowed.

- **The sheet named a game differently from every other screen.** Its Resume row read the title
  the scan wrote — the ROM's filename with its illegal characters replaced — so it said "The Elder
  Scrolls V_ Skyrim Special Edition" while the row above it used the colon. The same fault is
  fixed in Game Detail's "Launching…" and "Could not launch…" messages.

- **The Recent shelf offered a way into a row it does not draw.** The shelf replaces the crossbar's
  column wholesale and has no pill row, so stepping down at the end of the recents put the cursor
  on actions nobody could see.

- **Boot flashed bright amber for 2.3 seconds.** Measured on the panel: one frame of near-black,
  then RGB (158, 91, 55) held from 0.07s to 2.33s, then a crossfade down. The boot overlay was
  drawing the themed gradient so that boot and the menu would look identical — a premise that had
  been dead for a while, since the launcher opens on the Recent shelf and its backdrop is the
  focused game's own dark art. Boot is flat black now and the first colour on screen is the
  shelf's. The timings are untouched.

- **Windows had no door.** Library Manager filtered the Windows card out of its Consoles list, and
  the Settings row that was the only other way in had been removed on the reasoning that the list
  already showed it. It never had. A fully built screen — rename, Show In Games, pin, Import PC
  Games — was unreachable.

- **Two things were claiming the cursor.** The crossbar drew the full focus treatment on its
  selected slot at the same moment the item column drew it around the row the cursor was actually
  on, so Emulation glowed while the cursor sat on All Games. The bar keeps full brightness and its
  label — cues that say "this column is open" — and loses the glow and the size bump.

- **A video resume row wore four other films' art.** The art grid skipped rows that already had
  art, tested as one specific row type, which was correct until Video grew a resume row of a
  different type. It is decided by type now, so a video whose thumbnail has not been generated
  still shows an empty slot for its own thumbnail rather than four unrelated films.

- **A new display preference was not in the backup.** `display_fade_by_distance` was never added to
  the typed backup lists, so it silently did not survive a restore. The drift guard for exactly
  this had been red for three commits and was not seen, because a stale test-result XML from a task
  that had not re-run was being read as the current result.

- **Two crashes that were live on older Android.** `EpubMetadata` called a `ByteArrayOutputStream`
  overload that arrived in API 33 against a minSdk of 29 — a `NoSuchMethodError` while reading a
  book's metadata on Android 10 through 12. `EmulatorIntentResolver` called
  `isExternalStorageManager`, API 30, and survived on Android 10 only because Kotlin's
  `runCatching` catches `Throwable`: a linkage error caught by a net cast for something else.

- **Menu music started a new collector on every resume.** `repeatOnLifecycle` was being run from
  `onResume`, and it suspends until DESTROYED, so each resume stacked another collector on the same
  flow and they raced each other to start the track. It belongs in `onCreate`.

- **The settings picker could not be used by a finger at all.** No option row was clickable and
  neither was the scrim, so a touch user could open a picker and neither choose a value nor get
  out of it. The controller path — cursor, then SELECT — was complete, which is why this survived.
  Options take a tap directly and the scrim dismisses, the way BACK does.

- **The keyboard prompts named keys that did nothing.** The Keyboard glyph family shipped naming
  Shift, Space, Tab, Q and E while not one of them reached the launcher, and Escape — the key a
  keyboard user reaches for first — was bound to nothing. Binding those five was then wrong for a
  second reason: the gamepad handler consumes a bound keycode before any text field sees it, so
  they became keys you could not type. The defaults are now keys that produce no character —
  Escape, Tab, F2, F3, PageUp, PageDown — and a test holds the glyph table and the binding table
  together in both directions.

- **Leaving the Recent shelf cost a press that did nothing visible.** RIGHT spent itself closing
  the cover rail before it would step. It closes on the way past now: LEFT to the shelf and RIGHT
  back is one press each way.

- **The Recent shelf was unreachable by touch.** Its cover rail came in on LEFT and went away on
  RIGHT, and the media filter cycled on X — both D-pad only. So on the one screen a fresh install
  lands on, a finger could see a single item and had no way to reach any of the others. Tapping
  the artwork now shows and hides the rail, and each filter name is its own target, which a
  button cannot offer: X cycles, while every name is already on screen for a finger to pick
  outright. The cards and the launch spine were already pressable.

- **An empty Recent shelf was a dead end.** The shelf replaces the crossbar rather than sitting
  beside it, and it did so even with nothing on it — so a fresh install landed on "Nothing played
  yet." with no category bar, no Settings and no way out but a button you had to already know. It
  now stands in for the bar only when it has something to stand in with. Filtering to a medium you
  have none of still keeps the shelf and says "No recent games."; only "nothing played at all"
  hands the screen back.

- **The Recent shelf ignored swipes.** Every other part of the home screen steps category on a
  horizontal drag and item on a vertical one, through one shared gesture layer — and the shelf,
  the one screen that HIDES the crossbar, was the one screen that never got it. So the only way
  off it was the D-pad. It has the same layer now.

- **The launch spine covered the Apps button.** The spine runs down the whole right edge and the
  Filter / Search / Apps prompts sit in that same corner, so the spine was on top of Apps for 114
  of its 139 pixels — a finger aiming at Apps pressed Play instead, which on a shelf with
  anything on it launches a game rather than opening the drawer. It also meant Settings, which is
  reached through the drawer, had an 18%-wide door. The spine now stops above the prompt row; the
  bottom of its gradient had already faded to nothing down there, so nothing visible was given
  up.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-09-23

### Added
- **Menu music.** One track, looping, for as long as the launcher is the thing on screen. It gives
  way the moment anything else wants the speaker — every kind of audio-focus loss stops it,
  including `LOSS_TRANSIENT_CAN_DUCK`, where the polite behaviour would be to keep playing quietly
  underneath. Ducking is right for a navigation app talking over music; this *is* music. Off until
  a track is assigned, and driven from the Activity rather than a ViewModel because "the launcher
  is on screen" is an Activity fact and a ViewModel survives being covered by a game.

- **The launch ceremony's two cues are assignable.** `LAUNCH_DISC_AUDIO` opens it and
  `GAMEBOOT_AUDIO` sounds under the built-in disc. They share one one-shot player, so the second
  takes over from the first at the disc's exit rather than playing on top of it. GAMEBOOT_AUDIO is
  a slot that was retired once on the reasoning that GameBoot is one thing you replace wholesale;
  the case that brought it back is the opposite one, keeping the built-in disc and changing only
  what it sounds like. A custom GameBoot *video* still silences the slot, because a clip brings
  its own track.

- **A setup wizard you arrive at.** Black with the XMB wave on it, no settings rail, and no scrim
  over whatever wallpaper happens to be set — a first run must not depend on a picture the user
  has not chosen yet. It opens on the PSP mark and one press, which glows and shimmers its way
  into step one; first run only, because re-running from Settings is a task rather than an
  arrival. A page turn now makes a noise of its own.

- **Three new wizard pages.** Permissions (notifications, usage access and the Home role, together,
  because all three are system screens and meeting them one at a time is what makes a first run
  feel like an interrogation; all three re-read on resume, since none has a broadcast to observe).
  Books, which `MediaRootKind.BOOK` has supported for a while without the wizard ever asking. And
  Make It Yours — theme, sound, boot logo and wallpaper/layout as four rows that open the real
  screens, plus the XMB auto-fit checkbox moved off Finish.

- **Skip Setup on every wizard page**, on the north face button and tappable, intercepted before
  navigation so it works with a row focused, a field being edited, or nothing focused at all. It
  existed only on Welcome, so the moment you pressed Get Started the way out was eleven presses
  of Back.

### Changed
- **The launcher calls itself PSP.** Every user-facing "PFP" is now "PSP". Identifiers, theme and
  database class names, the log tag and the on-disk artwork directories are untouched — renaming
  those would move files that already exist on the device.

- **The Recent shelf reorders on every visit**, including a game launched through GameNative or
  any other app shelf entry.

- **Settings ▸ Interface ▸ Sound lists nine rows**: the six menu sounds, then Boot Sound and the
  two launch cues. A row with no bundled sample reads "None" rather than "PSP Default", which
  promised a sound no reset could produce.

### Fixed
- **A launch was refused because *we* could not read the ROM.** Preflight called
  `File.canRead()` on the path the emulator would open and blocked when it failed — but PSPLauncher
  targets a modern SDK and holds no broad file access, so that is false for everything on a
  removable card, while RetroArch targets SDK 28 with `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` and reads the same
  file without trouble. `canRead()` now decides anything only when we hold all-files access, where
  a failure really is about the file.

- **Every refused launch on Game Detail was invisible.** The reason was computed and recorded to
  `launch_outcomes`, then rendered into a row placed after the action row — which is the last thing
  before the scaffold's rule, so it drew off the bottom of the screen. Play appeared to do nothing
  at all. The reason moves above the buttons.

- **RetroArch launched to a black screen.** Three separate faults, each verified on a device:
  the wizard detected RetroArch with an exact `getPackageInfo("com.retroarch")` and so reported the
  aarch64 build absent, silently dropping its page from the flow; the cores link pointed at the
  visible `/RetroArch` folder, which holds config and saves and has never held a core, reported as
  "0 cores detected" rather than as the wrong folder; and `CONFIGFILE` was sent as
  `<dataDir>/retroarch.cfg`, a file RetroArch does not have, so it started on compiled defaults and
  drew nothing while the core ran, produced audio and wrote a save. Its real config is in its
  external files directory. Omitting `CONFIGFILE` is not the safe middle — with no config extra at
  all the launch is black too.

- **The Last Played shelf sorted a launch to the bottom.** `last_played_at` was being stamped with
  `SystemClock.elapsedRealtime()`, which is uptime, not a wall-clock instant. The dispatcher now
  carries both clocks: the monotonic one for measuring the session, the wall clock for the stamp.

- `resolveGameBootAudio`'s preview on the Sound screen auditioned the boot chime under three
  different row labels, because it reached the previewer through an overload whose slot parameter
  defaults to `BOOT_AUDIO`.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-09-22

### Added
- **The launch ceremony.** Selecting a game, film, book or track spins a disc before the thing
  opens, and the window transition is suppressed (`ActivityOptions.makeCustomAnimation(ctx, 0, 0)`
  plus `FLAG_ACTIVITY_NO_ANIMATION`) so the launched app takes the screen without sliding PFP away
  underneath it. The tail holds on black rather than revealing the XMB: the hand-off lands
  somewhere in that hold, and black is the only thing that can be under a hand-off without being
  the wrong thing. A launch that fails reveals the page immediately, so its error is never trapped
  behind an invisible screen.

- **Search activates instead of describing.** A game or film opened from search plays, rather than
  landing on its detail page for a second press of A. Tracks already did. The detail page still
  opens underneath and is what backing out returns to. Books and photos are unchanged — their
  detail page *is* the reader and the viewer.

- **Finished background work says so on screen.** Scans, imports and their failures draw a
  notification pill in the top left for a few seconds. Progress does not: a music scan reports once
  per file. The pill is deliberately not gated on `POST_NOTIFICATIONS`, which governs the system
  notification and has nothing to do with drawing inside our own window.

- **Music gains Artists and Albums**, and the Artists list splits a joint credit line using the
  library's own evidence: a name becomes its own act when some track credits it alone, and
  consecutive unproven fragments rejoin into the one name they are. So "Kendrick Lamar, SZA"
  becomes two artists, "Tyler, The Creator, Kali Uchis" becomes two and not three, and
  "Earth, Wind & Fire" stays one band. `album_artist` is scanned and migrated (schema 51); it is
  not backfilled, so an un-rescanned library reads exactly as it did.

### Changed
- **The Recent shelf is the reference layout.** A thin status bar with the filters or the sort mode
  centred in it, the art rail hidden until LEFT brings it back, page tabs as capsules, the toolbar
  at half size, and Play moved out of the middle of the page to a spine down the right edge in the
  focused item's own colour, with the word itself shimmering.

- **ScreenScraper uses the account's thread allowance.** `maxthreads` was parsed and printed in
  Settings and never acted on; the gate was a mutex with a comment that guessed the value. Threads
  and request spacing are now enforced separately, so an account allowed more than one gets more
  than one. Clamped to 1..8 — the field arrives from a server, and an allowance of "0" is not a
  rate limit but a hang.

- **Touch controls live in the footer** with the controller prompts, rather than competing with
  them, and are selectable so both routes behave the same way.

### Fixed
- A quick music rescan reused rows wholesale and so never filled `album_artist`; the reuse check
  now requires the column to be present.
- The music browser's Sort pill read "Sort: Sort: Title".
- A on a book, track or video row on the Recent shelf did nothing.

### Removed
- **TheGamesDB is gone as a provider.** The API client, its key (storage, Settings field, first-run
  wizard card, debug credentials file entry and backup entry), its place in the capability table
  and the tiered matcher, its metadata preset, and its Artwork Studio source are all deleted.
  Remaining sources: ScreenScraper, SteamGridDB, IGDB, and the Steam store provider.

  `games.tgdb_id` is kept and documented as retired rather than dropped. `minSdk` is 29, whose
  SQLite has no `ALTER TABLE ... DROP COLUMN`, so removing it means rebuilding the whole `games`
  table and its indices in a migration — real risk for no gain, since nothing writes the column
  and it was NULL on every row. The serialized `tgdb_id` in the portable artwork index and the
  `.pfpgame` export IS dropped; both readers are built with `ignoreUnknownKeys`, so an older
  library or export still parses, and a test now pins that rather than assuming it.

### Changed
- **Renamed to PSPLauncher, with a new mark.** The launcher is now PSPLauncher — the repository's
  own name read as an initialism (Platform Selection Portal). The PlayField "P" is replaced by a
  **PSP** wordmark, supplied as two purpose-cut assets in `core:core-ui`:
  `psp_icon_mark.png` is the launcher icon's foreground and its Android 13+ themed-icon monochrome
  layer — white on transparency, placed inside the adaptive icon's 66dp safe circle so no launcher
  mask can clip it — over a black background layer. `psp_logo.png` is the boot mark, the wordmark
  in a ring; it draws through `PortalIcon` rather than a plain `Image`, which is what that entry
  point is for: the alpha carries the shape and the tint replaces the colour, so the art is legible
  on the wave and follows the theme's icon colour instead of a hardcoded white. It is sized as a
  fraction of the screen's short edge rather than a fixed dp box, so it never overflows a small
  screen. The old raster art (`ic_launcher_foreground.png`, `pfp_boot_logo.webp`) is deleted, and
  Credits drops its "App Icon & Logo" section, since that artwork no longer ships.
- **Package renamed to `com.psplauncher`.** `com.playfieldportal` is gone from every namespace,
  source path, manifest and ProGuard rule; `applicationId` is now `com.psplauncher.launcher` and
  the release APKs are named `PSPLauncher-<version>.apk`. Room's exported schema history moved with
  it (`schemas/com.psplauncher.core.data.database.PFPDatabase/`), since the export directory is
  keyed by the database class's fully-qualified name and the migration tests read it back. The
  FileProvider authority needed no change: it was already derived as `${applicationId}.fileprovider`
  rather than written out. **The `/storage/emulated/0/PlayFieldPortal/` folder keeps its name** —
  it holds real user themes and backups, and renaming it is a data move, not a string change. The
  new application id cannot upgrade an install of the old one; migrate with Backup & Restore.

### Removed
- **Discord Social, and with it the Full/Lite split.** The Social column, the Discord account and
  friends list, activity/presence sharing, voice rooms and push-to-talk are gone, along with the
  `:discord:discord-native` NDK/CMake bridge, the vendored Discord SDK aars (Git LFS), and
  `:feature:feature-social`. The two product flavors existed only to include or omit that SDK, so
  the `distribution` dimension goes too: there is now one build, and the application id loses the
  `.lite` suffix. Settings ▸ About drops its Edition row, the twelve `catbar_social` /
  `item_social_*` icon slots leave the theme schema, `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` (the PTT overlay's
  permission) leaves the manifest, and the eleven Discord preference keys leave backup — restore
  ignores keys it does not know, so an older `.pfpbackup` still restores. Ktor drops out of
  `:core:core-data` and zxing out of the version catalog; both were there only for the QR login.

### Fixed
- **Restore refused the backups this app writes.** `BoundedZipReader` was introduced as the one
  bounded ZIP reader for themes, the theme codec and backup restore, and its own header records
  that "the backup reader capped nothing. Taking the union makes the strongest reader the floor" —
  which handed restore the THEME limits: 512 entries, 32 MB per entry, 128 MB in total.
  `BackupManager` caps nothing on the writing side and bundles `artwork/`, `wallpaper/`,
  `custom-icons/` and `ui-media/` whole, so a real library's backup is thousands of files and
  gigabytes. The two sides disagreed: a 1.53 GB archive written minutes earlier was refused,
  `RestoreWorker` returned FAILURE after three seconds, and the screen said nothing at all.
  Restore now passes `BACKUP_ZIP_LIMITS` (200,000 entries, 256 MB per entry, 32 GB total) — sized
  for a library rather than for a `.pfptheme` from a stranger, while still refusing a bomb. The
  default parameter on `RestoreArchive.read` stays theme-sized on purpose, so a caller that
  forgets is refused loudly instead of running unbounded.
- **A restored backup can no longer put a retired category column back.** Restore upserts whatever
  categories the archive carried, and the archive is usually written by the older build you are
  migrating away from — so a pre-removal backup reinstated the Social column, which then drew with
  no icon (its entry is gone from the catalog) and did nothing when selected, because the shell has
  no branch for it any more. `BuiltInCategory.RETIRED_IDS` now names the ids this build has dropped
  and `CategoryRepositoryImpl.pruneRetiredCategories()` sweeps their rows and category items — on
  every cold start's reconcile, and once more straight after a restore so the dead column never
  survives even until the next launch. It is the same job `UiMediaStore.pruneOrphans()` already did
  for retired media slots, one table over; as with those keys, a retired id is never reused.

### Added
- **Drag anywhere to scroll, and back out by going left (C15).** Two input-model gaps on the same
  surfaces. A drag on a Settings header, on the helper footer or on the Setup Wizard's chrome did
  nothing, because every one of those screens lays its chrome out as a *sibling* of its scrolling
  body — there was simply nothing under the finger to scroll. A new shared
  `Modifier.dragToScroll(ScrollableState?)` hands those regions the body's own scroll state, the
  one the scaffold already held for controller keep-in-view, so the dead bands now drag the list
  while taps on the ◀ breadcrumb and on rows keep working. Twelve sub-screens (Credits, the Library
  Manager's and Category Manager's detail pages, the Emulator wizard's steps) owned a scroll state
  they never registered, so they were dead in both directions; they register it now.
  The second gap: backing out cost a button press. D-pad **LEFT** now leaves a folder, a flyout, a
  settings screen or a wizard page — but strictly as a *fallthrough*, only where LEFT was already a
  documented no-op, so stepping into a row's inline buttons and adjusting a slider are untouched.
  It ships on by default and can be switched off in *Settings ▸ Controller ▸ Left Backs Out*. In
  touch mode a **leftward swipe** does the same inside a flyout or folder, committing on release
  past a fixed threshold, mirroring the existing left-edge pull rather than adding a second
  gesture detector to race it. The drill-out ladder itself — which used to be written out twice,
  identically, in the gamepad BACK branch and the touch one — is now one `backOutOfDrill()`, and
  `isInSubItem` is *defined* as "there is a level to back out of" rather than as its own parallel
  list of conditions, so the three callers cannot drift apart.
- **GameBoot is one thing you can switch off or swap out (C13).** The GameBoot transition
  between confirming a game and the emulator opening used to be an off-by-default boolean with
  nothing to show or play — a fading title over black, in silence. It now ships a real default:
  `GameBootSequence`, a Compose-drawn PSP-style light sweep running the full 5.000 s of the
  bundled `sfx_launch` sample, with its bloom riding a table of that file's measured loudness so
  the light lands on the sound's own hits rather than near them. The sequence is drawn, not a
  bundled video, so it costs no decoder warm-up at the moment the user is waiting for their game,
  picks up custom themes, and honors the wave-style motion budget (a frozen or reduced style
  draws one still frame instead of the sweeps — at the same full length, because the budget drops
  motion, not duration). The budget it reads is the user's style plus power throttling, NOT the
  wave's `effectiveWaveStyle`: that value is frozen whenever an opaque layer covers the wave, and
  during a launch the layer covering it is GameBoot itself, which froze the sequence on every real
  launch while the settings preview animated normally. The timeline is driven by wall-clock frame deltas rather than a tween, so
  a reduced system animator scale cannot cut the presentation short and let the emulator take the
  screen while the sound is still playing.

  The setting is a plain **on/off toggle**, and there is now exactly ONE thing to replace: assign
  your own MP4 or WebM and it takes over the whole presentation, its own audio included; Reset
  GameBoot to Default brings the built-in sequence back, the same shape as resetting a sound. The
  clip may run up to **10 seconds** — twice the built-in sequence, matching the boot clip's
  ceiling, because five seconds is too tight to author anything with a build and a payoff. The
  earlier three-way mode (Full Sequence / Sound Only / Off) and the separate GameBoot Sound slot
  are gone — an install carrying either migrates read-time, and the retired `gameboot_audio` slot
  is swept by `pruneOrphans()`. Fresh installs get GameBoot on; established installs keep the old
  silent default. The audio is gate-owned and fire-and-forget, so the full clip always plays out —
  even when the motion-budget path tears the visual down early, the sound finishes over the
  emulator's silent boot instead of being chopped at the launch, and the launch itself waits for
  the whole presentation in every case. **Preview GameBoot now plays its sound**: it previously
  resolved an audio path and handed it to a draw-only overlay, so the preview was a silent light
  show whose timing was matched to a sample the user could not hear. It runs through the same
  singleton player the gate uses, and silences itself when a preview is skipped (nothing is
  launching, so nothing would take audio focus and cut the clip).
- **Boot Sequence is one field, and media rows share one shape everywhere.** Display ▸ Boot
  Sequence had four rows for its media — Boot Animation, Boot Sound, a Preview row and a Reset row
  — while Boot Sound was already the seventh row of Interface ▸ Sound. It is now a single Boot
  Video field, the same shape GameBoot has: the built-in logo animation until your own clip
  replaces it, with Boot Sound left to the screen that owns every sound in the app.

  Both Display media fields are now the same `MediaAssignmentRow` the Sound screen uses, rather
  than a copy of it, so preview and reset are inline actions on the row instead of separate rows
  underneath, and the two controller shortcuts work identically on all three screens: the
  north-facing face button restores the PFP default (only offered while something custom is
  assigned) and the west-facing one previews. Both are bound to physical positions, so an X/Y
  layout swap moves the glyph in the prompt bar and never the binding. Focus returns to the row
  after a pick, a cancelled pick, or a reset, so the cursor no longer jumps away when a row's
  inline action disappears.
- **Launch reliability: every game launch is now verified and recoverable (B1).**
  All game-path launches funnel through a single `LaunchDispatcher` in feature-launcher,
  which owns `startActivity` with named failures (the XMB's direct-launch path used to
  swallow them into a log line), records every attempt to a new `launch_outcomes` table
  (schema v41), and verifies the emulator actually came to the foreground using the
  home-launcher lifecycle handshake (a launch that never covers the launcher inside 6 s is
  classified as never-foregrounded instead of silently "fine"). Failures raise a recovery
  sheet — retry, change emulator, per-system defaults,
  copyable diagnostics — and preflight now also refuses launches with revoked SAF grants
  or emulator launch activities dropped by an update. Game Detail's error line gains a
  "Get help" affordance into the same sheet.
- **Onboarding names the next step instead of generic empty states (B3).** A derived
  `SetupState` (feature-launcher's `SetupStateProvider`) watches the live stores — ROM
  roots, console Memory Cards, emulators — and names the FIRST unmet condition in order
  (add a ROM folder → add a console card → install an emulator). The XMB's empty All
  Games and empty Memory Card rows render that gap and deep-link to the screen that
  fixes it when confirmed (replacing the write-only `library_setup_complete` pref).
  The wizard's FINISH page gains "Go to your library", landing on All Games with the
  cursor on the first playable game, and the ROM-roots page offers "Create Standard
  Folders" — one ES-DE-named subfolder per supported console, answering "where do I
  put my ROMs?" in one tap.
- **Untrusted backup archives get a hardening pass.** `.pfpbackup` restore now routes
  everything through a bounded, root-confined reader: zip bombs (entry count, per-entry
  and total inflated size) are refused instead of OOMing, staged files may only land in
  the folders a backup owns (`artwork/`, `wallpaper/`, `emulator_profiles/` — no more
  overwriting the live DataStore), and emulator profiles arriving from a backup are
  screened before they can ever receive a ROM URI grant. The launch path mints ROM
  `content://` URIs only for files inside a configured Memory Card source, so the
  FileProvider's broad `/storage/` root is no longer reachable with arbitrary paths.
- **ScreenScraper developer pair ships obfuscated in the APK.** The
  `devid`/`devpassword` pair used to compile into every APK as a `BuildConfig` string
  (recoverable from the binary with `strings` — R8 does not touch string literals), and
  an interim user-entry-only design stranded users who could not obtain a pair. The
  build now XOR-encodes the pair from `local.properties` into `BuildConfig` byte arrays
  (keystream = SHA-256 of an obfuscation salt plus the property name), reassembled at
  runtime by a pure decoder — defeating casual `strings` scrapes, not a determined
  decompiler. There is no user-entered override: the bundled pair is the only one, and
  the optional per-user ScreenScraper account is unaffected.
- **Game Detail names the emulator and core that will actually run a game — and why.**
  The info panel's Emulator row now shows the winning profile, the RetroArch core it
  maps (when one exists, by its curated label), and which configuration level decided
  the pick (per-game override / memory card default / platform default / recommended),
  so "launched into the wrong emulator" stops being a mystery. The row is tappable and
  opens the per-game-only change flow. The resolution ladder is extracted out of
  GameDetailViewModel into feature-launcher's `EmulatorLaunchResolver` — a typed
  `ResolvedLaunch(profile, core, source)` with the precedence pinned by
  `EmulatorLaunchResolverTest` — and the alias/core-path mapping the launch path,
  profile repository, and UI each carried privately is now one shared
  `EmulatorPlatformMapping`.
- **Per-system emulator defaults (Settings ▸ Emulators ▸ Per-System Defaults).**
  One row per console with games shows the emulator + core its games resolve to
  today, how many games that covers, and how many override the default — the
  invisible-override count that used to explain "why does only this one game
  launch wrong". Drilling in lists every installed emulator that can run the
  console (the catalog recommendation flagged, the in-use default marked), sets
  the console default without touching any game, and bulk-clears that console's
  per-game overrides behind a confirm (real game rows only — app shortcuts are
  never touched). Rows resolve through the same `EmulatorLaunchResolver` Game
  Detail uses, so the two screens can never disagree.

### Changed
- **Emulator profile reads are suspend and screened.** Profile loading declares its IO
  dispatcher instead of relying on call-site coincidence, and every persisted profile
  (which chooses an intent target that later receives a ROM grant) passes an admission
  whitelist — custom commands, malformed package names, self-targeting profiles, and
  unknown intent flags are refused with a logged reason.

### Fixed
- **The Notification sound is cut until it gets real triggers.** It fired at the end of every
  full-library rescan — which the rescan bus runs on app resume, media mount and USB unplug —
  plus backup and restore completion, so the chime landed at seemingly random moments. The event
  is parked at the player: ordinary playback drops it, while the bundled sample, the Sound screen
  row and every call site stay untouched (Preview still auditions it), so re-enabling later is a
  one-line change. This is an interim hold; the event returns with deliberate triggers.
- **GameBoot off is now a silent launch.** The toggle stopped the animation and the gate's own
  audio, but the confirm sites' launch-sound suppression was keyed on GameBoot being ON, so with
  the toggle off the menu's Launch Sound fired instead — the same bundled `sfx_launch` sample the
  built-in sequence is timed to, just from a different player. A game boot is never scored by the
  menu launch chime: the XMB direct-launch confirm and Game Detail's Play now suppress the App
  Launch sound for game launches unconditionally (GameBoot owns `sfx_launch` when it is on, and
  with GameBoot off the launch is silent by decision), the now-dead `gameBootEnabled` flag is gone
  from both view models, Game Detail's manual Play falls back to the select chime instead, and the
  Display ▸ GameBoot sublabel no longer promises the old stacking behavior.
- **The controller helper footer now appears on every settings screen, not just Sound.**
  `shouldShowSettingsHint` was gated on `activeSettingsScreen == "settings_audio"`, but
  `SettingsScaffold` reserves and draws the footer band on every non-wizard screen — so on Display,
  Controller, Backup and the rest the band sat permanently empty behind a divider, and the idle
  delay the user had configured could never fire. The gate is now simply "a settings screen is
  open"; screens that supply their own prompts (Display's media-row shortcuts, Sound's) show those,
  and the rest fall back to Enter/Back as the scaffold already intended. The Context Menu Hint
  toggle and the shared 1-5 s delay still govern it.
- **Settings content no longer looks guillotined at the bottom edge.** The scrollable content sat
  flush against the helper footer's divider, so a section header scrolled under the fold was cut
  mid-glyph by a hard rule and read as clipping rather than "there is more below". The content
  viewport now fades out over its last 16 dp, dissolving a partial row into the same background the
  footer band already shows. The fade shares its constant with keep-in-view clamping, so a focused
  row's bottom edge lands exactly where the fade begins and the cursor is never dimmed.
- **Closing an emulator on purpose no longer pops a "closed almost immediately" warning.**
  The old verdict ran on a 10-second session timer, so deliberately closing an emulator right
  after it opened was reported as a crash and raised the recovery sheet. The dispatcher now
  classifies purely from the lifecycle handshake: the emulator covering the launcher proves a
  real session, however short (an instant close is the user's choice, and the session records
  as a success), and only a launch that never demonstrably covers the launcher inside the 6 s
  stop window is treated as never-foregrounded.
- **A console's RetroArch core can no longer silently change between sessions.** RetroArch
  scopes saved configs per core, so "configs saved for a console" stopped applying to other
  games whenever the automatic pick flipped cores — e.g. Game Boy/GBC games jumping between
  Gambatte and mGBA as cores were installed or removed, or PFP and RetroArch's own menu
  disagreeing on the core for the same console. The launch ladder now remembers the RetroArch
  core each console last launched with (DataStore-backed `AutoCoreMemory`, written by the
  shared `LaunchDispatcher` once a core launch actually reached the emulator) and keeps
  preferring it while that core is still installed — standalones still win the automatic pick
  when present, explicit per-game / memory-card / platform choices are untouched, and a core
  that is genuinely gone falls back normally. Game Detail, the Per-System Defaults screen, and
  the XMB's direct-launch path all resolve through the same stabilized pool, so they can never
  disagree about which core a console's games use.
- **Theme and backup archives share one bounded ZIP reader.** The theme loader, theme
  codec, and backup restore each hand-rolled part of the same ingestion policy at three
  quality levels; a crafted archive could hang or OOM depending on which path it rode
  in on. All three now go through `core-archive`'s `BoundedZipReader`, so the strongest
  reader is the floor rather than the exception.
- **PlayStation button glyphs are now the DualSense set, and Zacksly is properly credited.**
  The PlayStation prompts used the PS4 Premium pack at 480px, which read heavier and larger
  than the flat 128px Xbox and Switch art beside it; they are now the PS5 pack's
  Buttons Solid / White / 128w, so all three families share one treatment. The bundled art is
  unmodified. Settings ▸ Credits, the README and `assets/UI/ui-art-credit.txt` now carry the
  attribution its CC BY 3.0 license requires — author, source, license and a modification
  statement — which the app had been missing entirely for these packs.
- **The Auto-match report is counts-only.** Settings ▸ Shiba Coins now shows one
  dismissible "Matched N · Unmatched M" row instead of a long per-game list — each
  unmatched game's reason still shows on its row in the Shiba Library's Untracked view.

### Fixed
- **Media roots picked in the setup wizard now build their libraries.** The wizard
  persisted the Music / Photo / Video root but never ran the first scan, so the XMB's
  "+ Add" getting-started rows stayed up and the sections sat empty until the user found
  Rescan in Settings. Picking a root in the wizard now kicks off the same
  single-library sync and scan the settings screens run, on a scope that survives the
  wizard closing, with the usual scan notifications.
- **RetroAchievements syncing works in release builds.** The RA client's POJOs name a
  Gson deserializer in `@JsonAdapter` annotations; it is only ever constructed
  reflectively, so release minification stripped its constructor and marked it abstract,
  making every sync's converter creation throw — while matching, whose types don't use
  it, kept working. Root-caused with a desktop R8 reproduction of the exact stack and
  fixed with a keep for the client's core package.
- **RetroAchievements works in release builds.** The official RA client deserializes its
  API responses with Gson reflection, and release minification renamed those model
  classes' fields — every RA call threw and auto-match reported "Couldn't load the
  RetroAchievements game list" (debug builds were unaffected, which is why it never
  reproduced in development). Keep rules now cover the RA client's models and its
  network adapter. Confirmed from a device log: the minified exception decoded to
  Gson's JsonIOException via the release build's R8 mapping.
- **Cue/bin disc games can now hash through SAF.** A `.cue` sheet opened via a content
  URI (how the whole SAF-first library loads) previously could not reach its sibling
  `.bin`, so every cue/bin PSX, Saturn, and Sega CD game silently fell to "Unsupported
  disc image" during Auto-Match. The referenced track file is now resolved as a sibling
  document under the ROM root's tree grant, with the same path-traversal guard as the
  filesystem path.
- **RetroAchievements hash lists no longer time out.** The RA client ships with 10-second
  HTTP timeouts baked in; the registered-hash list Auto-Match joins against runs to
  several megabytes on big consoles and could not download in time on device Wi-Fi, so
  matching failed while regular per-game syncs (small responses) kept working. The
  achievements client is rebuilt with timeouts sized for those responses, and hash-list
  failures now log their cause to the Settings ▸ Logs file.
- **RetroAchievements auto-matching no longer fails silently.** A failed fetch of a
  console's registered-hash list (offline, server error, or RetroAchievements not yet
  connected) came back as an empty list and was cached for the whole app session — every
  game on that console then reported "ROM hash isn't registered" no matter how many times
  Auto-Match ran. A failed fetch is now never cached (the next run retries) and is
  reported as its own reason: check your connection and RetroAchievements credentials.

### Added
- **Hide games from All Games.** A game's context menu inside the All Games card now
  offers "Hide from All Games" — the game disappears from the aggregate view but stays
  on its own Memory Card, in collections, and in Favorites. Hidden games are recoverable
  from Settings ▸ Hidden Items, like every other per-location hide.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added
- **Auto-Matching from the Shiba Coins hub.** The Player Card, All Tracked Games, and
  Untracked rows' options menus gain **Auto-Matching**: one action that batch-matches
  every unlinked game (RetroAchievements hashes, Steam, Local Steam) and then runs Sync
  All Coins so fresh links land with their coins. The hub rows show "Auto-matching
  n / m" then the usual sync progress.
- **Per-game Auto-Match for RetroAchievements.** The Shiba Coins screen of an unlinked
  retro game now offers Auto-Match: hash-only (no copy question, no manual entry) — the
  ROM is hashed and looked up, a fresh link syncs immediately, and a failure explains
  itself (unreadable ROM, unsupported disc, hash not registered, or list unavailable).
  The game's Untracked note is updated to match the attempt.
- **Shiba Coins achievement system.** Games earn coins from achievements across three
  providers — RetroAchievements, your Steam account, and local Steam-emulated PC games
  (GSE/Goldberg) — with bronze/silver/gold/platinum tiers, an account-wide wallet with
  levels and ranks on the Player Card, a per-game coins screen, and a Shiba Library hub
  with an All Tracked view. Sync everything at once with **Sync All Coins** on the
  Player Card menu.
- **Fullscreen Player Status view.** Confirm on the Shiba Coin Player Card (on the XMB
  or in Settings) opens an account-wide standing screen: level, rank and XP up top, then
  Recent Achievements beside the Shiba Coin Wallet and your Rarest Achievement Unlocked.
  Rank shows its bone count with a theme-tinted bone glyph, and a recent unlock from a
  library game opens that game's Shiba Coins screen. Fully D-pad drivable, offline reads.
- **First-run setup wizard.** Fresh installs now open a guided four-page wizard
  (Welcome, Root Folders, Online Services, Finish) instead of landing on an empty XMB.
  It configures the ROM / Music / Video / Photo / Artwork roots and the SteamGridDB,
  IGDB, ScreenScraper, RetroAchievements and Steam accounts — every step optional, with
  live credential tests for IGDB and ScreenScraper. Upgrades with an existing setup
  never see it, and it can be re-run any time from Settings.
- **Auto-Match on the Shiba Coins screen.** Manual Steam linking (appid field,
  match-by-title, Find-on-Steam picker) is replaced by one Auto-Match button that asks
  whether your copy is a legitimate Steam one: Yes runs the Steam matching ladder
  (embedded appid, SteamGridDB, title variants), No scans the windows game folders for
  Steam-emu data and links the game as Local Steam — with a widened single-game ladder
  (exact name, the folder appid's official Steam name, then unique containment) and
  typed results that explain exactly what to fix when nothing links.
- **Local PC game achievement tracking.** Windows game folders under the ROM root's
  `windows/` library are discovered by their Steam-emu config; unlock progress is read
  from the emulator's save redirect or the conventional `saves/` folder (see README
  4.17). Tracking is display-only and gated on a save location existing.
- **One-step emulator kit generation.** When a PC scan finds an emu game folder with
  `steam_settings` but no `achievements.json` (the file the emulator needs before it
  can record unlocks), PFP offers to bring the game up to a current gbe_fork setup —
  per game, with No / Yes / Yes-to-All choices scoped to that scan. Generation writes
  the achievement schema and stat files from the Steam Web API, sets the save redirect
  into the game folder, and swaps the game's `steam_api` DLL for the bundled emulator
  (the original is backed up alongside; the swap is idempotent and rolls back on any
  failed write). Available from both the XMB Windows card's "Scan This Console" and
  Library Manager's PC scan.
- **Local Steam tracking is opt-in.** The whole subsystem sits behind a
  **Track Local Steam Games (Emulated)** toggle in Settings ▸ Shiba Coins (default
  off). Enabling it first shows a warning to back up your emulator save files; with it
  off, no discovery, schema generation, DLL swap or syncing ever runs.
- **Hidden achievement descriptions for emu games.** The Steam Web API permanently
  withholds hidden achievements' descriptions; for games your account does not own, PFP
  now fills earned hidden coins from the public community pages of known completionist
  profiles — rate-limited, size-capped, and falling back to the redacted text on any
  failure.
- **Shiba Library filter and sort.** All Tracked gains a provider filter
  (All / RetroAchievements / Steam / Local, cycled with Y) and both views gain six sort
  states (Title / Progress / Console, each ascending or descending, cycled with X). The
  per-game coins screen adopts the same X/Y bindings, and both screens snap the focused
  row to a steady reading line instead of lagging behind held input.
- **PC library plumbing.** Exported launch files import from `<windows>/import/`, OS
  pinned shortcuts reconcile at startup and across launchers, and one shared full PC
  scan backs every entry point.
- **Root-driven console management.** Add Console now derives each console's folder
  from your ROM Root — one grant covers every console, and the per-console folder
  picker and Change Directory rows are gone. Windows skips the emulator step (PC
  launchers are not emulator profiles) and its Scan Now runs the real PC import scan.
  Root rows in Library Manager list the consoles homed under them.
- **Windows card auto-setup.** Auto-Detect from ROM Root now finishes with the shared
  Import PC pass: it creates the Windows Memory Card, wires `<root>/windows` as its
  directory, creates the `import/` drop folder, and imports exported games in the same
  action. The card's default name is now "Windows Memory Card".
- **Re-scan can remove missing ROMs.** Library Manager gains
  **Re-Scan All (Remove Missing)** behind an inline confirm: the same directory walk
  also deletes entries whose ROM file has vanished. Removal is skipped for any console
  whose scan errored, so an unmounted SD card can never wipe a library.
- **Per-console metadata and artwork passes.** The memory-card menu's placeholder
  Refresh rows become real actions: **Update Metadata** (text-only, artwork untouched)
  and **Scrape Missing Artwork** (only games missing primary art), with background
  progress and result counts.
- **Custom icon color.** The Icon Color strip is now controller-drivable (Left/Right
  picks a swatch), and a new **Custom** swatch opens an HSV picker — Hue / Saturation /
  Brightness bars adjustable by D-pad or touch.
- **Breadcrumb headers across menus.** Detail screens, every settings screen, the Music
  browser and the Shiba Library share one breadcrumb idiom: a leading back arrow plus
  the title stack as a single tap target that backs out.
- **Three-level Artwork Studio navigation.** The Studio's zones are now strictly
  hierarchical — Category, Sources, Grid. Confirm descends, Back ascends, LB/RB pages
  the grid, Y opens the per-slot options through the shared PSP-style context menu, and
  the crop editor layers the full-screen image under floating controls.
- **GameHub Lite local game ids.** Add-by-ID accepts the `local_<uuid>` ids GameHub's
  Copy button produces, and bare numeric ids on the Ludashi V5 build resolve against
  both the Steam and local id namespaces automatically.
- **Logs open externally.** Confirm on a log file now opens the system "Open with"
  chooser; the options button offers the existing redacted Share.
- **Achievement credits.** Settings ▸ Credits and the README now credit the Shiba Coins
  data sources — RetroAchievements, Steam (Powered by Steam; Valve trademarks), and the
  bundled Goldberg Steam Emulator (gbe_fork by Detanup01 and contributors, original by
  Mr. Goldberg) with its LGPL-3.0 license and source links.

### Changed
- **Direct launch is seamless.** With Launch Games Directly on, confirm boots straight
  into the game — the Game Detail page no longer flashes first, but is fully formed
  underneath when you exit back out. A failed launch reveals the page and its error.
- **Context menus slimmed.** The game menu is navigation-only (Launch Game, Edit Title,
  Edit Note — everything else lives in Game Detail); the All Games menu's scan rows are
  replaced by one **Manage Library** entry opening Library settings; the Windows card
  gains **Import PC Games**; Android games drop every Shiba Coins surface (they can
  never have achievements); and the app menu's manual Import Game Shortcuts is removed
  (automatic shortcut capture is unchanged).
- **Every stock dialog matches the dark theme.** PFPTheme now installs a dark
  MaterialTheme derived from the shared palette, so playlist naming, the schema prompt
  and the Windows setup prompt no longer fall back to Material's light purple. Also,
  every read-only settings row is controller-focusable, so info footers are no longer
  dead zones the cursor cannot reach.
- **Smaller APK.** The boot logo and Shiba coin art are re-encoded as right-sized WebP
  (~3.5 MB saved at identical on-screen quality) and an unreferenced 899 KB drawable is
  gone.

### Fixed
- **Logo-less game titles show immediately** — the active row's label no longer waits
  650 ms for a logo overlay that never appears.
- **The wizard cannot strand or be stranded.** Setup-seen is stamped on deliberate exit
  (not on open), so a crash mid-wizard re-opens it; installs configured only through
  modern flows are recognized as set up; and the boot animation holds until the
  first-run check resolves, so the XMB can never flash before the wizard.
- **Wizard flows match Settings.** ROM roots picked in the wizard take the same
  read+write grant as Library Manager, credential test statuses clear on step
  navigation, and the connect/test flows are shared code with the settings screens.
- **A failed emulator DLL swap now rolls back** — a write failure mid-swap previously
  left the game unlaunchable and unrepairable; the original DLL is restored on any
  failure.
- **Local Steam sync is cheaper and better-behaved.** A Sync All pass now walks the
  windows folders exactly once instead of once per tracked game, and Yes-to-All schema
  generation paces its Steam Web API calls like every sync source.
- **Android games are excluded from the untracked list** — they can never have
  achievements, so they only inflated the count.
- **Shiba screens follow the controller correctly** — the Game Detail coin strip frames
  itself when focused, the coins screen's focus order matches its layout, and the
  Player Status page scrolls from the rarest card.
- **Refresh on Game Detail no longer wipes the whole library's artwork.** The Refresh
  action called the repository's `clearCache()` after its single-game scrape — a call
  whose meaning had since grown into the full "Clear All Artwork" reset (stored files,
  artwork records, and every game's art references). Refresh now evicts only that game's
  image URIs from the display cache, which is all it ever needed; the destructive reset
  remains exclusively behind Settings ▸ Artwork ▸ Clear All Artwork. Artwork files in a
  linked portable folder were never deleted by the bug — Scan & Relink Library restores
  them; internally stored art must be re-scraped.
- **Scan & Relink restores the full-screen background again.** The scraper reuses the
  hero file as the XMB background whenever a hero exists, so most games have no
  `fanart/` file of their own — after the refs were wiped, the relink walk found nothing
  under BACKGROUND to refill from and the background stayed missing. Relink now mirrors
  the scrape's rule: a hero file also repoints a missing or dead background column.

### Security
- **Photo thumbnails moved to internal storage.** The thumbnail cache lived in app
  external files, readable by other apps holding the legacy storage permission on
  Android 10; it now lives in the app-private cache, and legacy locations are cleaned
  up once.
- **One shared Keystore AES-GCM implementation.** Scraper-key and Discord-token
  encryption now share a single hardware-backed AES-256-GCM helper; fresh installs try
  a StrongBox-backed key first. Existing installs decrypt unchanged.
- **CI hardened.** Every GitHub Action is pinned to a full commit SHA and the checkout
  token is no longer persisted into the workspace; the comment-triggered AI PR
  workflows (a spendable-API-key and unattended-push exposure) are removed.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-12

### Added
- **Live "Adjust XMB Layout" editor.** Settings ▸ Display ▸ Scale & Layout ▸ **Adjust XMB
  Layout** opens a full-screen editor over the real XMB: scale the interface and shift the
  crossbar up/down and left/right with instant feedback. Drive it with the D-pad and
  shoulder buttons (L1/R1 scale, Y reset, A save, B cancel) or an on-screen slider panel.
  Each screen size keeps its own tuning — a handheld, a foldable's inner display and a
  tablet remember separate scale/offset values — so one device's layout never distorts
  another's. Replaces the old fixed XMB Scale / Bar Height rows.

### Changed
- **Drill-in flyout tuned for wide screens.** The memory-card column is now icon-only while
  drilled into a games list (the console reads as a bare icon + ◀), the game column sits
  tight against the cursor, and on wide/foldable panels the whole cross pins to the left
  edge so the game cards, title and logo take the centre-right.

### Fixed
- **XMB no longer over-scales on foldables.** The canvas scale is now bounded by screen
  width as well as height, so a near-square inner display (e.g. the Galaxy Z Fold) is sized
  to fit instead of ballooning ~2.3x and truncating item labels. Standard 16:9 handhelds and
  tablets render exactly as before.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-07-12

### Added
- **Game Detail upgrades.** The action row is now Launch (renamed from Play) plus four
  square buttons: **Video** (plays the game's snap — external player if one is pinned in
  Settings ▸ Video, else a built-in fullscreen player), **Options**, **Artwork**, and
  **Manual**. A **Screenshot** panel renders under the info panels (scraped from
  ScreenScraper or ES-DE-imported). Controller polish: Up from the button row always
  returns to Launch, one Up rewinds the page scroll entirely, and D-pad scrolling strides
  farther per press.
- **Icon Display Modes.** Every game tile can now be drawn four ways: **Custom Icon** (the
  PSP-authentic 144:80 ICON0 fill), **Box Art**, **Physical Media** (cartridge/disc shot),
  or **3D Box Art** — the last three render at their art's natural aspect inside the same
  fixed slot, so row pitch never moves. Set the global default in Settings ▸ Artwork ▸
  **Game Icon Display**, from any Memory Card / All Games card's △ menu (**Icon Display**),
  or per game via its △ menu. Each mode has its own placeholder when art is missing:
  ICON0 → 144:80 letter tile, Box Art / 3D Box → a letter tile shaped like that platform's
  box, Physical Media → the bundled per-platform cartridge/disc icon. Storage-side, true
  box art now owns the ES-DE `covers/` folder while 144:80 icons live in the PFP-only
  `pfp/icon0/` namespace — existing libraries migrate automatically (same-tree moves), and
  Scan & Relink reclaims grids a pre-split scan may have mislabeled as box art.
- **ICON1 video snaps.** In Custom Icon mode, resting on a game for ~1.5 s plays its video
  snap inside the icon — muted, capped at 60 s, then fading back to the still, exactly like
  a PSP ICON1.PMF. Battery-conscious by design: one shared player, playback skipped under
  Battery Saver / low battery unplugged / thermal pressure, plus an **Animated Icons**
  master toggle. When ScreenScraper has no ready-made snap but does have the full video,
  PFP downloads it and converts it locally (60 s trim, icon-sized, audio stripped) — the
  full video is never stored.
- **PIC0 logo choreography.** The focused game's clear logo fades in center-right over the
  hover background on the PSP stagger (icon → PIC1 → PIC0). Game rows are icon-first: no
  text labels except the focused row of a logo-less game, whose title + emulator label fade
  in on the same timeline.
- **Launch behavior.** Settings ▸ Display ▸ Games ▸ **Launch Games Directly**: confirm on a
  game boots straight into it (Game Detail opens underneath and fires its own Play, so every
  launch path stays in one place); the game's △ menu gains **View Game Details** for edits.
- **Richer scrapes.** ScreenScraper now supplies box-2D, box-3D and cartridge/disc
  (support-2D) art for the display modes, plus player count, age rating, franchise,
  community rating and release date (persisted for the future Game Detail redesign).
  Manuals download by default now (still size-capped); video snaps remain opt-in.
- **Settings ▸ Logs is real now.** PFP writes INFO+ log files on every build (rotating,
  512 KB × 4 cap) with **privacy-first redaction at write time** — credentials, tokens,
  ScreenScraper account names and email addresses never reach disk — and the Logs screen
  can view them (controller: ▲▼ scroll, ◄ ► pan, Ⓐ share, Ⓑ close) and share a file for
  bug reports via the system share sheet.
- **DB v27.** New game columns for the display-mode art (`box_art_uri`,
  `physical_media_uri`, `box3d_uri`, `icon_display_mode`) and scrape metadata (`players`,
  `age_rating`, `franchise`, `community_rating`, `release_date`); ES-DE-imported "icons"
  that were really box art are reclassified in place.
- **Fullscreen Artwork Studio.** Game Detail's Artwork button now opens a controller-first
  full-screen editor (it replaces the old in-detail manager). One tab per artwork kind —
  ICON0, ICON1, Box Art, 3D Box, Physical Media, Hero, Background, Logo, Screenshot, Manual,
  Video — with LB/RB to switch tabs, Y to jump to the source row, and a results grid you
  navigate as a grid (not just left/right). Each tab offers whichever sources can serve it:
  **ScreenScraper**, **SteamGridDB** (full art with an NSFW filter you can toggle with X),
  **TheGamesDB**, **IGDB**, and **Local File**; ICON0 offers all of them for maximum choice.
  Results page ~20 at a time. Press A to preview a candidate before applying — video tiles
  play a muted looping preview on focus/long-press, and manual PDFs page through with
  Left/Right before you commit. Press **START** for the per-slot actions menu: **Adjust
  Crop / Position**, **Restore Previous**, **Reset to Scraped Default**, **Clear Artwork**,
  and **View File Information**.
- **Crop / position editor.** A fixed, aspect-locked frame per kind (ICON 144:80, hero
  920:430, background 16:9, others free) with the image panning and scaling behind it —
  D-pad to move and LB/RB to zoom on a controller, drag and pinch on touch. Crops bake into
  the displayed file while the untouched original is kept for lossless re-crops. ICON1 snaps
  crop too: the clip is re-encoded to the framed region, not flattened to a still.
- **Scrape-as-you-go ScreenScraper.** The Studio's ScreenScraper source no longer needs a
  prior scrape — browsing a never-scraped game triggers one live match on the spot and
  caches the result, so the next open (and the next full scrape) is a free cache hit.
- **DB v28 / v29.** v28 adds the `ss_media_cache` table (one ScreenScraper response carries
  every kind's URLs, so later scrapes and the Studio skip the metadata call). v29 adds
  provenance and versioning to `artwork_records` — origin URL and provider for the file-info
  panel, a one-previous backup for Restore Previous, and baked-crop bookkeeping. Both
  migrations are additive; the private `pfp/versions/` and `pfp/originals/` namespaces stay
  invisible to Scan and Export.
- **More ScreenScraper platforms.** Xbox 360, Commodore 64, Android and Windows games now
  resolve to their ScreenScraper systems (they were silently unmatchable before).

### Changed
- **Artwork cache accounting is honest.** Settings ▸ Artwork shows the real stored-artwork
  size (image cache + internal store; your artwork folder is never counted), and
  **Clear All Artwork** now truly resets: Coil caches, internal files, records and every
  game's art links — while never touching files in your artwork folder.
- **A custom wallpaper freezes the wave** (Display-picked or theme-applied) to save battery
  — the wave resumes when the wallpaper is removed. The wallpaper preview now dismisses
  with Confirm/Back as well as tap.
- **ES-DE export is more correct**: `covers/` now carries real box art instead of 144:80
  grid icons.
- About shows the real installed version (read from the package, not a stale constant) and
  About / Credits scroll with the controller; Credits now credit **ScreenScraper** as the
  primary scraper.

### Removed
- Display ▸ **Icon Style** (superseded by Game Icon Display — Physical Media mode is the
  cartridge look) and Artwork ▸ **Preferred Grid Style** (was never wired to anything).
- The old in-detail artwork manager, fully replaced by the fullscreen Artwork Studio.

### Fixed
- **Scrape Missing fills partial games.** "Scrape Missing Games Only" judged a game complete
  as soon as it had a background, so a game with a background but no box art or logo was
  skipped. It now targets any game missing primary artwork (background, box art or logo) and
  fills only the gaps — existing artwork is never re-downloaded or overwritten.
- **Studio video previews are reliable.** ScreenScraper serves videos with no length and no
  seek support, so clips whose index trails the data couldn't stream and the tile silently
  fell back to a badge. The Studio now streams first and, on failure, plays from a cached
  local copy.

### Added
- **Portable media library + ES-DE artwork import.** Settings ▸ Artwork ▸ **Artwork Folder &
  Import**: pick a folder (SAF, read+write grant — no all-files permission) where PFP keeps
  artwork as a user-owned, reconnectable library with a clean two-folder root —
  `Artwork/{platform}/{covers,fanart,marquees,…}/{ROM Filename}.png` plus an `Import/` drop
  zone and a root `pfp-artwork-library.json` manifest. The tree inside `Artwork/` is exactly an
  ES-DE `downloaded_media` layout, so pointing another frontend at it works with no export
  step. Libraries created before the `Artwork/` nesting upgrade themselves automatically
  (same-drive folder moves, zero bytes copied). Provenance (source, user-assigned, locked)
  lives in the `artwork_records` table. Drop another
  launcher's media under `Import/<Launcher>` (ES-DE `downloaded_media` in V1) and PFP detects it
  by structure, matches artwork to games in three passes (exact ROM filename → display title →
  tag-stripped title; ambiguities are reviewed, never guessed), shows a full preview (counts by
  media type, size, needs-review, unmatched), then imports in a background worker with
  notification progress. **Move mode** transfers same-volume files without copying bytes
  (`moveDocument`); copy mode uses in-kernel copies. Imports are resumable, respect existing and
  locked artwork, and land as ES-DE covers→icon, miximages→hero, fanart→background,
  marquees→logo, plus stored-for-later screenshots/title screens/physical media, and **PDF
  manuals** — the game's Options ▸ Manual action opens the manual **in-app** (built-in PDF
  renderer, no external viewer): D-pad ◀▶ turns pages, ▲▼ scrolls, B closes; touch taps the
  screen edges to turn pages and drags to scroll. Every run is logged to a persistent
  **Import Report**.
- **DB v25/v26.** `games.artwork_key` (stable portable identity), `artwork_import_reports`,
  and `artwork_records` — the rebuildable map over the artwork folder with per-asset
  provenance (replaces the interim `artwork_index`). Existing per-game-folder libraries are
  upgraded to the ES-DE layout in place (same-volume moves, lossless, automatic).
- **Game metadata import from ES-DE `gamelist.xml`.** Drop ES-DE's `gamelists` folder alongside
  the media and the importer fills each matched game's description, developer, publisher,
  release year, genre and canonical title — fill-missing-only, never overwriting scraped or
  user-set values. The Game Detail screen now shows publisher and total play time, and the
  page scrolls with the D-pad (DOWN past the buttons) as well as touch.

- **Scraped and hand-picked artwork now lands in the portable library too.** With a folder
  linked, every artwork save — metadata scrapes, SteamGridDB/TGDB/IGDB grid picks, local image
  picks — writes into `{platform}/{mediaDir}/{ROM Filename}.{ext}` alongside imports; without
  one, internal storage works exactly as before. Auto-scrapes never overwrite an existing valid
  library asset; hand-picked artwork is marked user-assigned + locked so nothing automatic
  touches it. "Clear All Artwork" clears app state only — files in the user's folder are never
  deleted (Relink restores them).
- **Scan & Relink Library** (Artwork Folder & Import) — one pass that reconnects folder
  artwork to games, refreshes moved/changed files, removes references to deleted ones
  (only ever with live folder access — a disconnected folder never destroys state), and
  reports duplicate names. Linking a folder that already contains ES-DE-shaped media —
  a previous PFP library or a plain `downloaded_media` tree — **adopts it in place**, zero
  bytes copied. A lost folder grant shows a warning on the Artwork settings row.
- **Export for ES-DE** — copies the library's standard media folders into any folder you pick
  (e.g. an ES-DE install's `downloaded_media`), incremental (existing files skipped), with
  notification progress and a report entry. The live library is never modified; `pfp/`-private
  art is never exported.
- Game Detail shows publisher and total play time; long descriptions are reachable by D-pad
  (DOWN past the buttons scrolls the page) as well as touch.
- **Move Into Folder** (Artwork Folder & Import ▸ App Storage) — artwork scraped or picked
  *before* a folder was linked lives in app-private storage; one tap moves it into the
  portable library (background worker, cancellable, resumable, report entry). Existing
  folder artwork always wins — a valid library asset is never overwritten, and the redundant
  internal copy is cleaned up. Hand-picked artwork migrates as locked. Game references
  repoint to the new files; internal space is freed only after each verified write.

### Changed
- `PlatformFolderHintResolver` and the SAF child-listing helpers moved from `feature-library`
  to `core-data` so the artwork importer shares the exact ES-DE system-name mapping and
  cursor-based directory listing the scanners use.

### Fixed
- Artwork scrapes are real background jobs now: progress shows in the notification shade, a
  **Cancel Scrape** row stops the batch after the in-flight game (everything fetched so far is
  kept), and the run survives leaving the settings screen — previously it ran invisibly inside
  the screen and silently died when you navigated away. Reopening Artwork Settings mid-scrape
  reattaches to the live progress.
- Scan & Relink now reconnects scraped artwork, not just imported artwork: files PFP wrote
  itself reconnect through their own records (exact claim), so sanitized-title names
  ("Resident Evil: The Mercenaries 3D" → no colon on disk) and collision-suffixed names
  ("Game (2).png") no longer fall through the fuzzy matcher as orphans. A library file also
  now replaces a game reference that points at a remote URL — a rotted CDN link no longer
  blocks the repoint and leaves the game artless.
- Video snaps saved into the portable library no longer fail silently — extension detection
  was image-only, so a valid MP4/WebM passed validation but never landed on disk; video files
  now save with correct names and MIME types.
- Artwork validity checks now understand `content://` references — previously every portable
  artwork ref was misjudged as stale, so "Scrape Missing Games Only" silently wiped imported
  artwork links (files were never touched; Relink Library restores them).
- Concurrent imports of two same-platform games could create a duplicate platform folder
  ("gba (1)") in the artwork library — directory creation is now serialized.
- Multi-row disc games (.cue + .bin scanned as two entries) no longer make their artwork
  "ambiguous"; both rows share the same imported files. Dump-index-prefixed artwork
  ("0556 - Game.png") matches its game at a degraded confidence.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-07-07

The 1.0 release. Touch-first navigation and a consistent, theme-matched UI across every
full-screen menu; a move to permission-free storage (ROM libraries, media and backups all go
through the Storage Access Framework, so the app no longer needs all-files access); a new
**opt-in Discord Social section** (QR sign-in, friends, presence sharing); and the **custom
theme system** — `.pfptheme` bundles with custom icons and per-theme layout, PSP `.ptf` import
(zlib + LZR), and the cross-platform **Theme Studio** desktop companion with its PTF unpacker.

### Added
- **Custom themes (`.pfptheme`).** The theme system, built on a one-color cascade — pick a
  background and one color and the wave, gradient, cursor, and icon tint all follow. Settings ▸
  Themes now offers 12 PSP-style preset schemes (7 → 12: adds Sakura Pink, Golden Amber, Aqua
  Teal, Midnight Navy and Charcoal, plus the month-cycling *Original*), a unified **icon color**
  for every XMB glyph (8 curated swatches; content imagery — game art, covers, app icons — is
  never tinted), **Quick Create** (any photo becomes a theme, accent auto-derived from its
  dominant hue), a **saved-theme library** with apply/share/delete, import of real PSP **`.ptf`**
  themes — wallpapers in both zlib (firmware 3.80+) and LZR compression (firmware 3.70 era), via
  an independent LZR decompressor; CXMB files are rejected with an explanation — and `.pfptheme`
  bundle share/import. Applying a theme drives wallpaper, accent, icon color, **custom icons**, and
  **per-theme XMB layout** in one step; choosing a preset scheme cleanly exits custom-theme mode.
- **`:core:theme-kit` module.** A pure-JVM theme parsing/conversion core shared by the launcher
  and the Theme Studio: official PSP `.ptf` container parser (built from a byte-level study of
  Sony's format — see `docs/official-ptf-template.md`), BMP/GIM decoders, the LZR decompressor,
  wallpaper accent derivation, `.pfptheme` codec, icon-slot registry, and the XMB layout spec —
  with a hermetic test suite plus golden tests against Sony's own example themes.
- **Custom icon slots.** Themes can replace 47 XMB glyphs — the 9 category-bar icons, the item-row
  glyphs (folders, playlists, social rows…), and the status-strip battery/Bluetooth icons. Custom
  icons render exactly as the author drew them; untouched slots keep the built-in art and follow
  the theme's icon color. Platform/console icons stay uniform by design.
- **Theme Studio (desktop companion).** A new `:studio` Compose Desktop app (Windows/Linux/macOS,
  `gradlew :studio:run` / `run-theme-studio.bat`) for making and converting themes: a live
  pixel-parity XMB preview with **Home / Context-menu / Fullscreen-menu** states, preset swatches +
  hex fields + **HSV color pickers**, an **icon editor** over every themeable slot with an editable
  template-pack export, wallpaper import with **crop presets** (PSP 480×272 / 720p / 1080p) and
  soft-wallpaper/dark-icon legibility hints, a **crossbar alignment assist** that auto-detects the
  dark band PSP wallpapers bake in (plus a manual position slider the launcher honors), export with
  an embedded rendered preview, **batch `.ptf` → `.pfptheme`** folder conversion, and a
  **PTF unpacker** ("Unpack PTF…") that extracts every resource of an official PSP theme —
  wallpaper, embedded preview, category ribbons, and item icons with their focused variants
  (GIM textures: indexed + direct-color formats, PSP swizzle, transparency preserved) — as
  reference PNGs for rebuilding the theme with original assets.

- **Discord Social section (opt-in).** A new **Social** column on the XMB. Sign in by scanning a
  **QR code** with your phone (OAuth2 device grant — no password typed on the handheld); tokens are
  stored **encrypted** in the Android Keystore and renewed automatically so you stay signed in.
  Drill into your account for **Friends** (avatars + a colored presence dot and what they're playing
  in PFP), **Activity Settings** (opt-in — default **off** — sharing that you're in Playfield Portal,
  with a **Generic Mode** that shows just "a game"), and **Discord Settings** (Sign Out). The account
  row's Options (Y/△) offers **Reconnect** for when the network drops and comes back. Everything is
  inert until you connect, and presence is limited by Discord to this app only — nothing outside PFP
  is ever shared. **Voice chat** rooms (join by code, invite friends) with Krisp noise cancellation,
  a Game↔Voice audio balance, and **push-to-talk** — either a floating hold-to-talk button that
  works over a running game, or a controller button you map yourself (held while in PFP). Discord is
  **optional at build time**: a **lite** build ships without the SDK for a ~44 MB smaller download
  (its native voice libraries are the bulk of the size) and simply omits the Social section.
- **Import PC Games.** New section under Library, and an option on the **All Games** card's Options
  menu. Detects installed PC launchers (BannerHub, GameHub Lite, GameNative, Winlator); **Add game
  by ID** builds each launcher's documented launch intent — with a **Test Launch** to verify — so
  the game launches straight back into the launcher (PFP is a frontend, never the PC runtime).
  Imported games land in a collection named after the launcher with the **Desktop PC** icon. Optional
  **Home mode**: set PFP as your Home app to auto-import every game a launcher publishes.
- **ES-DE ROM roots with one-scan autoload.** Grant a ROM root folder (internal storage **or** an
  SD card — multiple roots supported) and **Auto-Detect from ROM Root** walks its ES-DE system
  folders (`gba`, `snes`, `psx`…), creates a Memory Card for every folder that actually contains
  games, and loads them in a single scan. Empty folders are skipped; a system split across roots is
  merged into one console. ROMs load via `content://` URIs, so no storage permission is needed.
- **Set Up ROM Folders (ES-DE).** Pick an empty folder and PFP creates the standard ES-DE
  system-folder structure for you (no guessing folder names), so libraries transfer cleanly to and
  from a real ES-DE install.
- **Root Access** in the Library section. Lists granted ROM root folders as **Linked** or **Access
  lost**, with one-tap re-link (the picker opens pre-pointed at the saved folder). Recovers folder
  access after a restore or reinstall; re-linking a ROM root restores every console under it at once.
- **Single root folder for Music, Photos and Videos.** Each media section is driven by one folder,
  set in **Settings ▸ Music / Photo / Video**: *Root Folder* (shown), *Add / Replace Root Folder*
  (one SAF grant; replacing overwrites it — the picker opens pre-pointed at the saved folder so
  re-granting after a restore is one tap), and *Rescan* (fast incremental — new files in, deleted
  files out). Photo settings also has *Clear Thumbnail Cache*; Music/Video have a **Default Player**
  choice (PSPLauncher / System Default / a chosen app). Libraries update automatically after a
  scan. The XMB media sections show a single "＋ Add" getting-started row that opens the matching
  Settings section and disappears once a root has been added and scanned (even if it finds nothing).
- **Backups saved to a folder you choose.** *Back Up Now* writes the `.pfpbackup` into a
  SAF-granted folder — no storage permission, survives an uninstall, and stays user-accessible.
- **Full XMB touch navigation.** Swipe to step categories/items (discrete, D-pad-equivalent
  stepping with a small fling bonus), tap-to-point / tap-again-to-open, and a left-edge
  swipe for Back. A bottom-right contextual **App Drawer** button appears while using touch.
- **Touch UI that follows the last input source.** The header pills on the Game/App/Video/
  Photo detail screens and the Music browser (Back / Options / Sort) show only when the last
  input was touch and hide when a controller is used — the same behaviour as the XMB's
  contextual App Drawer button. Controllers keep their on-screen A/X/Y/B hints.
- **App collections for non-gaming categories** (Network, App Store, custom): create one from
  an app's Options, drill in, and move / rename / pin / delete — Android apps only.
- **Android Settings** entry at the top of the Settings category, opening the device settings.
- **Touch Sensitivity** setting (Low / Normal / High) in Settings ▸ Display, scaling swipe
  step distance.
- **Auto-fading photo title.** The photo viewer shows a centred title on each image, then
  fades it out after a short delay.
- **Touch prev/next in the photo viewer.** Left/right pill buttons (the touch counterparts of
  L1/R1, styled to match the Back / Options pills) page through photos; they dim at the first/last
  image and hide with the rest of the controls when you tap the photo.
- **Tablet display scaling.** On screens larger than a handheld, the whole UI (XMB cross, Settings,
  detail screens, drawer and dialogs) magnifies uniformly instead of leaving tiny, mis-aligned
  elements floating on a big canvas. One canvas-scale factor keyed to the screen size preserves the
  PSP proportions and alignment; the handheld is untouched (scale = 1) and very large screens are
  capped so nothing balloons.
- **Status-bar sort chip.** On touch, the XMB status bar's sort label becomes a tappable chip
  that cycles the sort order; on controller it stays a plain label (X / Square cycles it).
- Icons on all detail-screen action buttons; plus (＋) glyph on "Add Apps / Add Games" rows.

- **Hostile theme files can't hurt the app.** Every external-file path (PSP `.ptf`, `.pfptheme`,
  wallpaper/icon images — on both the launcher and Theme Studio) is bounded: 64 MB read caps at
  every entry point, zip-bomb and zlib-inflation caps, image-dimension pre-checks before any pixel
  allocation, icon names whitelisted against the slot registry (no path smuggling), per-theme
  layout values clamped so a mangled manifest can never push the XMB offscreen, and the PTF
  unpacker's LZR/GIM decoders bounded per record (32 MB) and in total (256 MB) so a crafted
  record chain can't expand into a decompression bomb.

### Changed
- **XMB geometry retuned to the authentic PSP layout**, pixel-measured against a real-PSP theme
  capture: the category bar sits higher (icon row ≈ 25% of screen height) with the selected item
  ≈ 50%, category icons and item glyphs are larger, item labels are bigger with a clear gap from
  the icon column, **every** first-level item is labeled (not just the selected one and the next),
  and the previous item rises fully clear of the category icon before dissolving. The geometry now
  lives in a per-theme layout spec (`theme-kit`), so imported themes can eventually carry their own
  alignment.
- **Detail screens reskinned to match the Music browser** — Game/App/Video/Photo now use the
  translucent theme-gradient backdrop (the XMB wave shows through) with header pills, and the
  XMB foreground is hidden behind them.
- **One shared themed context menu** for the Game/App/Video/Photo option popups, matching every
  other context menu (right-edge, wave-colour panel, accent cursor). App Detail now mirrors
  Game Detail: a single **Launch** button plus an Options menu holding the rest.
- **Y / Triangle** opens the Options menu on the Game and App detail pages.
- App-artwork files are **versioned**, so an icon/hero/background change is reflected
  immediately; closing App/Game detail refreshes the list so a new background shows on the XMB
  at once.
- **App Drawer:** white labels with a theme-accent filter highlight; a touch-aware grid cursor
  that hides during touch scrolling and resumes near the last touch position on the d-pad.
- Android Settings uses the wrench icon, matching the other Settings rows.
- **ROM libraries and backups now use the Storage Access Framework** end-to-end (`content://`),
  so they need no storage permission and work on SD/USB volumes. Older single-root grants and
  backups migrate transparently; restoring a backup re-links folders via Library ▸ Root Access.
- **Media scans skip folders they shouldn't index** — any directory with a `.nomedia` file, hidden
  `.`-prefixed folders, and the app's own thumbnail cache are pruned before descending. This keeps
  gallery/thumbnail caches and hidden data out of the library and speeds up rescans. Photo
  thumbnails now live in the app's external cache (`…/files/cache/thumbnails`, with a `.nomedia`)
  and *Clear Thumbnail Cache* empties it while preserving the marker.

### Removed
- **All-files access.** `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` is no longer declared, and the *Grant All-Files
  Access* option is removed from the Library Manager — ROMs, media and backups all use SAF.
- **Per-folder media library management** and the standalone Folder Access screen — Music, Photos
  and Videos are now managed as a single root folder each in their own Settings section (existing
  grants and roots carry over on upgrade).
- The dedicated **Photo Apps** section (the Photo category no longer lists installed photo apps).
- The floating **Back** button that replaced the App Drawer button while drilled in — going back
  is now the left-edge swipe or tapping the active memory-card icon under the caticon.

### Fixed
- **No more clipped half-row at the bottom of the XMB.** The home item column now renders only
  rows that fully fit below the active item, so a partial "peek" row is never cut off at the screen
  edge — on the handheld and (via the uniform canvas scale) on tablets alike.
- **Controller cursor no longer dies after opening a collection** in Settings ▸ Collections. Each
  step (list / detail) now owns its focus scaffold, so drilling into a collection re-assigns D-pad
  focus instead of leaving the cursor stranded (touch was unaffected).
- **Seamless full-screen-menu back-out.** The category bar no longer animates back into place
  when the XMB reappears after closing the Music browser / app drawer / Settings (the visible
  "snap"); the selected slot is now seated instantly.
- Non-gaming apps show their assigned background on the XMB, and artwork changes reflect
  without a restart.
- Tapping a caticon while drilled into a sub-item is a no-op; the contextual App Drawer button
  returns after tapping caticons.
- **Launch crash** on the current Compose BOM — `collectAsStateWithLifecycle` now reads the
  platform `LocalLifecycleOwner` (the `androidx.lifecycle.compose` variant isn't present and
  crashed at composition).
- Repaired 8 pre-existing unit tests that used improper Android mocks (stick `MotionEvent`
  action, launch `Intent`).

### Security
- **Theme parsers hardened against hostile files.** `.ptf` and `.pfptheme` files arrive from
  arbitrary sources via the file picker; crafted inputs could previously crash the app: the PTF
  wallpaper inflater now caps decompressed output (zlib bombs), the BMP decoder caps image
  dimensions (fixing an integer-overflow that bypassed its bounds checks), and the `.pfptheme`
  reader caps each zip entry (zip bombs). All three guards are pinned by tests.

## [1.0.0-alpha.3] — 2026-07-02

Third alpha. Adds a full **Photo** section and **Video** section polish, moves ROM libraries
onto the Storage Access Framework so SD-card storage no longer needs the all-files
permission, makes the status bar live, and lands another round of security hardening.
(`versionName 1.0.0-alpha.3` / `versionCode 3`.)

### Added
- **Photo section.** A PSP-style memory-card experience: **All Photos**, **Camera** (only
  when a camera app exists), **Add Photo Library**, and a single **Albums** entry that drills
  into your scanned folders. Add albums via the folder picker (SAF — no storage permission),
  browse `[thumbnail] name / resolution · date` rows, and open photos in a minimal
  full-screen viewer (hidden controls, zoom/pan, rotate, L1/R1 paging).
- **Set as Launcher Wallpaper.** From the photo viewer's options *or* a photo row's context
  menu — preview first, then apply. The image is EXIF-stripped and copied into app storage;
  GPS/location metadata is never read or stored.
- **SAF ROM libraries (Memory Cards).** Add a console's ROM folder through the folder picker
  and it scans/launches with **no storage permission** — including folders on SD cards and
  USB drives. `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` is now optional (only requested for older raw-path
  libraries).
- **Live status bar.** Wi-Fi and cellular now show real signal strength and hide entirely
  when there's no connection/service; Bluetooth shows only when enabled; a controller icon
  appears when a gamepad is connected. No new permissions.
- **Video "Collections."** Recently Watched, Favorites, and Playlists are grouped under a
  single **Collections** entry, trimming the Video root.
- **Level-aware drill flyout.** The two-pane flyout's left column now shows the *current
  level's* siblings — a library among your libraries, an album among your albums, a playlist
  among your playlists — matching how Games shows the console cross.
- **App drawer: single-press launch.** A single tap now launches an app (long-press opens
  its menu), matching the controller's single-select-to-launch.
- **Video detail: resume-aware actions.** A watched video leads with **Resume** plus **Start
  from Beginning**; unwatched videos show **Play**. The action list scrolls.

### Changed
- **Faster library scans.** Photo/Video/Music scanners now list each folder with one
  DocumentsContract query instead of several IPC round-trips per file; photo deep-scans also
  probe files with bounded parallelism. Recursive scanning is on by default with a per-album
  *Include Subfolders* toggle.
- **Theme-adaptive menu cursor.** Every menu's focus highlight (Settings, context menus,
  pickers, detail/player option lists, app drawer) now derives from the active color scheme
  with a bright edge, so the cursor stays clearly visible on any theme.
- **"Add …" rows** across Photo/Music/Video sit at the bottom of their section with a **＋**
  glyph, and cursor position is remembered per view across every category (and future custom
  categories).
- Built-in theme renamed **Classic PSP Blue → Classic Blue** (trademark hygiene; the theme
  id and look are unchanged).
- State collection is lifecycle-aware, so the XMB stops recomposing while backgrounded behind
  a game or emulator.

### Fixed
- App drawer no longer lets a tap fall through to the XMB behind it (which could open the
  Music library "for no reason"); the XMB isn't composed while the drawer is up.
- Removing a photo/album/video/video-library now also deletes its cached thumbnails, so
  removed content is fully forgotten.
- Reopening a video no longer needs two taps; the two-pane flyout and back navigation are
  consistent across all drill levels.

### Security
- **Theme loader hardened (Zip Slip / zip-bomb).** `.xmbtheme` extraction now rejects any
  entry that escapes the theme directory, sanitizes the theme id, and caps per-entry, total,
  and entry-count sizes — a malicious pack can no longer overwrite app files or exhaust
  storage. Covered by regression tests.
- **Privacy-first Photo/ROM SAF model.** Only user-picked folders are read (tree-scoped
  content URIs, no `MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` for new libraries), nothing is uploaded, and
  scanners are hardened against cyclic/duplicate provider entries.
- Redundant per-file `DocumentFile` permission lookups replaced with tree-scoped
  `DocumentsContract` queries, keeping every scan within the granted folder.

## [1.0.0-alpha.2] — 2026-07-01

Second alpha. Adds a full Music section, a PSP-authentic XMB redesign (cross layout,
two-pane drill flyout, and the real "wave" background), menu sound effects, and a round of
security hardening. (`versionName 1.0.0-alpha.2` / `versionCode 2`.)

### Added
- **Music library & player.** Scan SAF music folders, browse **All Music** as
  `[cover] [title] {artist}` rows, and play in a full-screen player (play/pause, seek,
  previous/next). Album art is extracted from tags and cached on device.
- **Background playback.** "Play in Background" keeps music going via a foreground media
  service with a media-style notification (play/pause, prev, next, stop) and MediaSession,
  so you can leave PFP and keep listening.
- **Playlists.** Create, rename, and delete playlists; add/remove tracks from a song's
  options menu or an in-playlist "Add Tracks" picker.
- **Music section redesign.** Root shows **Now Playing** (only while a track is loaded),
  **Playlist**, **Music Apps** (your picked installed music apps), and a single **Music**
  memory-card item collecting all scanned tracks. A fullscreen, searchable browser backs
  Music and Playlists.
- **Two-pane drill flyout (all drill-ins).** Drilling into a Games sub-item (a platform,
  All Games, Favorites, a collection) **or** a Music section shows the PSP two-pane flyout:
  the memory-card "cross" on the left with a `◀` on the active card, and the drilled
  content pinned to that line on the right — previous card above, next below, uniform
  spacing. Game rows are labeled `[Title]` / `{Platform (Emulator)}`.
- **Authentic PSP wave background.** The XMB background is now the real PSP "wave" — soft,
  slow light folds over a theme-tinted gradient (AGSL shader on Android 13+, with a Canvas
  fallback). Colors follow the active color scheme.
- **Menu sound effects.** The XMB/ES-DE sound set (scroll, select, back, launch, favorite,
  category change) with a **Menu Sounds** toggle in *Settings → Display → Sound*.
- **Sort cycling (X / □).** Cycle sort per list — games (Title / Recently played / Date)
  and music (Title / Artist / Album / Date); the current mode shows in the status strip.
- **Settings item icons.** Every Settings row now shows a wrench badge, matching the rest
  of the XMB.

### Changed
- **PSP-authentic "Original" theme.** True XMB cross layout (the selected row seats just
  under the caticon, the previous row half-clips above the crossbar, icons locked on the
  caticon's vertical line); a single theme hue across the whole XMB; selection conveyed by
  scale + alpha with crisp white labels.
- **Reference-accurate blue gradient.** The default gradient anchors were sampled from the
  real XMB wave — saturated azure top easing to a brighter cyan-blue near the wave — and
  every scheme's gradient now stays a rich, saturated color instead of fading to navy/white.
- **Collections** render the physical-media memory-card art instead of the blank default
  icon, so they read as memory cards.
- **Android library** reworked to be app-picker driven, isolated from ROM libraries, and
  removable ("Remove from Library"); music-folder management moved to *Settings → Music*.

### Fixed
- Seamless XMB wave loop (no skip on repeat).
- Replacing a wallpaper now actually updates the image (unique filename defeats the
  path-keyed image cache).
- **Reset Hidden Apps** action added (hiding an app previously had no in-app way back).
- Settings background scrim lightened so the wallpaper/wave shows through.
- Tightened XMB item tap targets so stray touches in empty row areas no longer select/launch.
- Added breathing room between wide artwork tiles and their titles.
- Item list hard-stops on a row boundary — no partially-clipped rows at the top or bottom.
- Alpha release build fixes (signing, R8/manifest, app-drawer crash).

### Security
- **Captured-shortcut hardening.** Externally-supplied `INSTALL_SHORTCUT` intents are
  sanitized (all URI-permission grant flags and ClipData stripped, target pinned to a
  resolved installed component) at capture **and** at launch, closing a confused-deputy /
  arbitrary-file-read vector. Captured shortcuts now require an explicit **Add** confirmation
  (handled by a non-exported receiver the sender can't forge); silent library poisoning is
  prevented.
- **Network policy.** Cleartext (HTTP) denied app-wide; release builds trust only the system
  CA store (user-installed-CA MITM blocked); debug builds still trust user CAs for proxying.
- **Secrets encrypted at rest.** Artwork/metadata API keys are encrypted with an
  AndroidKeystore-backed AES-256/GCM key.
- **Backups disabled.** `allowBackup=false` plus data-extraction rules keep the library DB
  and API keys off cloud backup and device transfer.
- **Least privilege.** Removed dead exported receivers; All-Files access is requested only
  point-of-need (a prompt in *Settings → Library*), so SAF-only and app-picker users never
  grant it.

## [1.0.0-alpha.1] — 2026-06-28

- Initial alpha: XMB launcher shell, ROM library scanning, artwork scraping, emulator launch,
  gaming categories/collections, controller mapping, and touch controls.
