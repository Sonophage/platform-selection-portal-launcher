/**
 * Phase 7 verification for the missing-ROM write policy (docs/missing-roms-plan.md).
 *
 * Two things are being proven here, and the second matters more than the first:
 *  - the add / remove / re-add matrix reaches the right flag state, and
 *  - an untrustworthy survey NEVER flags anything. That is the "pull the card and nothing
 *    vanishes" guarantee, and it is the case where a regression silently mass-flags a library.
 *
 * Every assertion checks the DAO calls rather than just the returned counts, since the counts
 * could be right while the wrong paths were written.
