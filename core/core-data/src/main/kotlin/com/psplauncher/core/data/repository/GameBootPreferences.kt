/**
 * The GameBoot switch — one boolean for the one presentation shown between confirming a game and
 * the emulator taking the screen. On means the GameBoot sequence plays, sound and all; off means
 * nothing plays at all — the animation and its sound both stay down, and the launch is silent by
 * decision (a game boot is never scored by the menu's App Launch sound, which is the same
 * sfx_launch sample the built-in sequence is timed to).
 *
 * Lives in core-data (not feature-launcher) because THREE feature modules read the same key and
 * must never disagree: the [com.psplauncher.feature.launcher.GameBootGate] gates the launch
 * on it, the XMB and Game Detail confirm paths keep their launch-sound suppression keyed on the
 * fact that a game boot is a GameBoot boot (on or off), and the Display settings screen renders
 * and toggles it.
 *
 * **Migration is read-time** — there is no one-shot pass to miss, and [resolve] IS the migration.
 * The short-lived three-way `display_gameboot_mode` key (never released) reads back as on/off, and
 * an install that never touched GameBoot keeps the old silent default (off for an established
 * install, on for a genuinely fresh one — "new installs get the sequence, existing users keep what
 * they have").
 *
 * The one write-side exception to "read-time only": [setGameBootEnabled] REMOVES the legacy mode
 * key in the same atomic edit it writes the boolean. That is what makes the precedence in [resolve]
 * unambiguous — while the mode key exists it is the user's most recent choice and wins; the moment
 * they touch the toggle it is gone and the boolean is authoritative forever.
