/**
 * One recorded game-launch verdict (B1 — launch reliability). Written after the launch attempt is
 * settled: immediately for an intent/preflight failure, or when the host lifecycle classifies a
 * successful dispatch as a real session or a never-foregrounded launch.
 *
 * Deliberately a dumb log row: the emulator/core/source snapshot is captured at launch time so the
 * row always says what WAS launched, even if the user changes defaults later. `outcome` stores the
 * feature-launcher enum name (SUCCEEDED / NEVER_FOREGROUNDED / INTENT_FAILED) and `source` the B4
 * LaunchSource name — core-data stays free of feature types and maps through LaunchOutcomeRecorder.
