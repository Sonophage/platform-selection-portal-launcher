/**
 * One game's achievement set on one provider, keyed by the provider's own identity — the single
 * source of truth for coin summaries whether or not the game exists in the library. Library games
 * resolve here through [ProviderGameLinkEntity]; account-imported games have no link and live here
 * alone. Per-coin detail lives in [AccountAchievementEntity].
 *
 * Constraint the schema can't show: rows are never cascade-deleted with a library game — account
 * history outlives library membership, and provider disconnect keeps data cached (July 2026
 * decision). See docs/account-achievements-plan.md.
