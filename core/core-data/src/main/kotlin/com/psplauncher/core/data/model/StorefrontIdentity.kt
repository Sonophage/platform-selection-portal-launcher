/**
 * The storefront a Windows game came from, and its id on that store — the identity a PC game
 * loses today because `PcGameScanner.buildPcLaunch` computes both and then throws them away
 * (C16, root cause "no Windows identity").
 *
 * Persisted on `games.storefront` / `games.storefront_game_id` as an evidence PAIR: an app id is
 * only unique within its own store, so `("STEAM", "620")` and `("GOG", "620")` are different
 * games and must never match each other.
 *
 * Parsing is pure string work over the `Intent.toUri(URI_INTENT_SCHEME)` form rather than
 * `Intent.parseUri`, so the backfill migration and its tests run on the JVM with no Android
 * runtime and no risk of an intent-parse side effect during a database upgrade.
