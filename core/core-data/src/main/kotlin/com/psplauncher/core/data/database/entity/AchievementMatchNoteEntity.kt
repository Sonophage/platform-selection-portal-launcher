 * Why a game failed to link during the last auto-match — the specific reason its ROM/disc couldn't
 * be hashed or matched (couldn't read the file, unsupported disc format, hash not registered, no
 * title match, …). Surfaced in the hub's "Untracked" section so the user knows what went wrong,
 * not just that it's untracked. One row per game; cascade-deleted with its game.
