/**
 * Maps a library game to its identifier on an achievement provider — the bridge through which
 * game-keyed reads resolve to account-keyed achievement rows. Composite key (game_id, provider):
 * a game may hold one link per provider (STEAM and LOCAL_STEAM coexist for owned games played
 * through an emulator — July 2026 decision). Set automatically or by hand; cascade-deleted with
 * its game, while the account rows it points to survive.
 * See docs/local-steam-achievements-plan.md and docs/account-achievements-plan.md.
