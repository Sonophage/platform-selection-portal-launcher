/**
 * The Android side of [WallpaperLuminanceMap]: decodes a wallpaper file small and hands back the
 * stored form of its luminance survey, so the XMB can size text protection per label.
 *
 * The survey itself is pure JVM and lives in `theme-kit`; this object exists only because
 * `BitmapFactory` does not. It deliberately returns the **JSON string** rather than the map:
 * `core-data` depends on `theme-kit` with `implementation`, and keeping the parsed type out of the
 * public signature means callers that only *write* the key need no theme-kit import at all.
 * Readers (the XMB) parse with [WallpaperLuminanceMap.fromJson], which is also where staleness is
 * detected.
 *
 * See `docs/plans/text-legibility-font-color-plan.md`.
