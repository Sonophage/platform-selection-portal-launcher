/**
 * What PFP actually knows about the libretro cores installed in RetroArch.
 *
 * RetroArch keeps cores in private internal storage, so the only way to know what exists is the
 * user's SAF grant ([RetroArchLink]). PFP used to model this as `Set<String>?`, where null meant
 * "no idea" — and the one caller that saw null answered by *inventing* a list of nineteen cores the
 * user probably had. Those invented profiles were persisted as available, won the automatic
 * platform default, and launched RetroArch with a core path that did not exist: a black screen.
 *
 * Naming the states removes the guess and, more importantly, makes [isAuthoritative] explicit.
 *
 * **The invariant: never mutate stored user configuration from a non-authoritative inventory.**
 * Only [Verified] reflects a live read of the real directory. Every other state means PFP could not
 * check, and a state that cannot confirm a core is present equally cannot conclude one is absent —
 * so it may change what is *offered*, never what is *stored*. Without this rule a lost SAF grant
 * (a RetroArch reinstall is enough) would let a routine startup pass delete profiles and cascade
 * into the platform defaults, memory-card assignments, and per-game overrides that reference them.
