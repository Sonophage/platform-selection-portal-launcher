/**
 * Applies the missing-ROM write policy after a scan of one console's roots.
 *
 * A game whose file was seen is marked present (missing flag cleared, last_seen_at stamped); a game
 * whose file is gone is marked missing — never deleted, so its favorite/play-stats/artwork survive
 * and it reappears in every view once the file returns. Real deletion is only ever the user's
 * explicit "Remove permanently" action, never this path.
 *
 * Removals are applied ONLY when the survey is trustworthy: the scan didn't error, produced a
 * non-null present-set, and that set isn't suspiciously empty against a non-empty library (a
 * half-mounted card must never mass-flag the whole console as missing).
