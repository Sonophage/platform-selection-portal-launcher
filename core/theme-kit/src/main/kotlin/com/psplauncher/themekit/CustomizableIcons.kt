 *
 * `IconSlots.ALL` is the bundle contract (keys are zip entry names) and its KDoc states
 * console art is deliberately not a slot — so this registry EXTENDS it without touching it:
 * [ALL] keeps `IconSlots.ALL` as a verbatim prefix, and the codec still gates `icons/`
 * entries on `IconSlots.isValidKey` while `sysicons/` entries gate on [isValidKey]'s
 * console arm. Slot keys are used verbatim as file names, which makes [isValidKey]
 * load-bearing: it is what stops a crafted key escaping its directory.
