/**
 * Import gate for user-picked motion wallpapers. Playback discipline cannot rescue a file that
 * should never have been accepted, so the gate runs BEFORE anything is copied, and every
 * rejection names its reason.
 *
 * Every number here is a judgment call rather than a hardware fact — which is why they live in
 * one object the tests point at: tuning a limit later is a one-file change.
 *
 * Lives in theme-kit (pure JVM), not core-ui, because BOTH sides of the feature need the same
 * numbers: the launcher's Android importer probes with MediaMetadataRetriever, and the desktop
 * Theme Studio validates the GIF it transcodes against exactly these caps before embedding it.
 * Two copies would drift, and the drift would show up as a Studio-authored theme the launcher
 * silently refuses.
 *
 * Tested by MotionLimitsTest, including the boundary at each cap.
