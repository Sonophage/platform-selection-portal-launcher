/**
 * Import gate for user-picked UI media — menu sounds (Interface ▸ Sound), the boot sequence's
 * video/audio, and GameBoot's one replaceable clip. Same contract as [MotionLimits]: playback discipline
 * cannot rescue a file that should never have been accepted, so the gate runs BEFORE anything is
 * committed, and every rejection names its reason.
 *
 * Every number here is a judgment call rather than a hardware fact — which is why they live in
 * one object the tests point at: tuning a limit later is a one-file change.
 *
 * AUDIO policy (owner decision, 2026-09-08): **no floor and no user-facing byte cap.** The
 * recommended range is advisory only and every audio spec's floor is zero — a 0.2 s click is a
 * legitimate Navigation sound. The lag/abuse protection is [Spec.hardMaxMs]: SoundPool decodes a
 * custom menu sound fully into memory, so the per-event duration ceilings (0.5–3 s) are what
 * bound the decoded footprint, and a boot track streams through ExoPlayer where its 10 s cap
 * bounds the presentation instead. The audio [Spec.maxBytes] values are NOT a quality limit —
 * they are the staging-copy ceiling (see [AUDIO_STAGE_MAX_BYTES]) that stops a malicious picker
 * from streaming gigabytes into app storage before the duration gate can reject the file.
 *
 * VIDEO keeps both a floor and a real byte cap: a clip feeds a timed presentation and is probed
 * with MediaMetadataRetriever, and 25 MB comfortably covers any sane MP4/WebM of the allowed
 * lengths.
 *
 * Lives in theme-kit (pure JVM), not core-data, because BOTH sides of the feature need the same
 * numbers: the launcher's Android importer probes with MediaMetadataRetriever, and the desktop
 * Theme Studio must validate a future `.pfptheme` sound pack against exactly these caps before
 * embedding it. Two copies would drift.
 *
 * Tested by UiMediaLimitsTest, including the boundary at each cap and the drift pin that every
 * UiMediaSlot carries an entry.
