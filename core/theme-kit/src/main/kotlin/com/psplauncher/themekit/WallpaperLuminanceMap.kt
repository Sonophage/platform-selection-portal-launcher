/**
 * A coarse luminance survey of the user's wallpaper, so the XMB can decide per-label how much
 * protection its text needs.
 *
 * The XMB is the one surface in the app that genuinely draws text on raw wallpaper — everything
 * else (Settings, App Drawer, storefront, detail, music, context menus) paints a scrim of *known*
 * colors, so its effective background is a closed-form composite with no sampling needed. See
 * `docs/plans/text-legibility-font-color-plan.md`.
 *
 * Runtime sampling was rejected: `PixelCopy` needs a Window/SurfaceView and the wallpaper is a Coil
 * `AsyncImage`, while `GraphicsLayer.toImageBitmap()` would mean a GPU→CPU readback every frame in
 * a launcher whose background architecture is built on the opposite principle — and it would end up
 * sampling our own text. Surveying once at import time costs single-digit milliseconds behind a
 * spinner that already exists.
 *
 * ### Why two numbers per band
 *
 * [LuminanceBand.mean] decides *polarity* — whether light or dark text is the right starting point
 * for this region. [LuminanceBand.p90] decides *protection strength*, because a plain mean hides a
 * bright cloud sitting behind one word: a band that averages 0.2 but reaches 0.8 at its 90th
 * percentile will eat white text exactly where the label falls.

/**
 * [ROWS] × [ZONES] luminance bands covering the whole wallpaper, plus the path they were computed
 * from.
 *
 * **The stored values are WCAG relative luminance, not Rec.601 luma.** This is the trap in this
 * file: [WallpaperMetrics.luminance] is Rec.601 and does *not* compose with the contrast engine's
 * `contrastRatio`. Mixing the two yields thresholds that look plausible and are wrong — 4.5:1
 * decisions made against a Rec.601 number are simply a different question than the one WCAG asks.
 * `WallpaperLuminanceMapTest` pins the two apart deliberately so nobody "unifies" them later.
 *
 * [source] is the wallpaper path the survey describes. It is embedded rather than tracked by a
 * separate stamp key because wallpaper files are already uniquified per import (so Coil's cache
 * invalidates on its own); a reader that finds a mismatch simply discards the map and recomputes.
