 * The motion wallpaper entry — described, not materialised.
 *
 * Every other part of a bundle is a [ThemeImage]: a wallpaper is a megabyte or two, an icon a
 * handful of kilobytes, and holding those as `ByteArray` costs nothing worth avoiding. A motion
 * wallpaper is a video, routinely tens of megabytes, and the launcher's heap is capped at the
 * device's `dalvik.vm.heapgrowthlimit` (256 MB on a Thor) with a live Compose UI already in it.
 * Holding one as a `ByteArray` cost roughly three copies — the source bundle, the
 * `ByteArrayOutputStream` that doubled past it while inflating, and the array copied out of it —
 * which is what made a 52 MB theme import, list and apply as `OutOfMemoryError`.
 *
 * So this type carries no bytes. It knows its extension and how to *stream* itself somewhere,
 * once, on demand. Both directions use it: [PfpThemeCodec.write] streams it into the zip, and a
 * bundle read back from a file streams it out of that file.
 *
 * The content is therefore not held, which has one consequence worth stating plainly: two
 * `ThemeMotion` values compare by extension, never by content. Comparing two videos byte-for-byte
 * would mean reading both into memory, which is the thing this type exists to prevent.
