/**
 * The four Shiba Coin tiers, PlayStation-style. Each carries its coin value in the unified XP
 * economy (ratio 1 : 2 : 6 : 20, matching the PSN trophy weights).
 *
 * Bronze / Silver / Gold come from a difficulty signal that differs by provider:
 *  - **RetroAchievements** uses the achievement's own **point value** via [forRaPoints] — RA already
 *    weights achievements by difficulty (its standard values are 0-5 / 10 / 25 / 50 / 100), so the
 *    points are the natural tier spine there.
 *  - **Steam** has no points, so it falls back to global unlock rarity via [forRarity]
 *    (Gold under 10%, Silver 10-24.99%, Bronze at 25% and above).
 * Platinum is different: it is the 100% mastery award, minted locally when a whole set is completed,
 * and is never derived from either signal. See docs/shiba-coins-achievements-plan.md.
