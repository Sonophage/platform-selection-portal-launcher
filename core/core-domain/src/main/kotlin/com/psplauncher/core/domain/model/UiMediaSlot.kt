/**
 * Every UI-media slot a user can personalize, and the ONE registry for their stable storage keys.
 *
 * A slot's file lives at `filesDir/ui-media/<key>.<ext>` — [key] is used verbatim as the file
 * name, which makes [isValidKey] load-bearing: it is what stops a crafted key escaping the
 * directory (the same guard pattern as theme-kit's `CustomizableIcons.isValidKey`). The enum
 * makes an escape impossible through the API surface today; the guard exists so the invariant
 * is enforced in one place rather than assumed by every caller.
 *
 * [limits] carries this slot's caps from the design doc's table — see [UiMediaLimits].
 *
 * The menu-sound roster is the seven-sound plan's: Navigation covers SCROLL, SELECT and
 * SYSTEM_BROWSE (one sample, three events — see [UiMediaSlot] docs in
 * docs/plans/README.md (C10)), and Boot Sound is the seventh row of the Sound screen
 * while staying an AUDIO_TRACK slot. Slots removed from this enum are swept from user installs
 * and restored backups by `UiMediaStore.pruneOrphans()`; their keys are deliberately NOT reused.
