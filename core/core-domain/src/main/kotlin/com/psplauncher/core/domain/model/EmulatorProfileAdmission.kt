 * Decides whether an [EmulatorProfile] that came from outside the app may be used.

 * A profile is not inert data. It chooses the `ComponentName` an intent is aimed at, the extras it
 * carries, and — for `CUSTOM_COMMAND` — a command string; and the package it names then receives
 * `grantUriPermission(packageName, romUri, READ)` at launch. A `.pfpbackup` is an untrusted file,
 * so the profiles inside one are the most valuable thing it carries.
 *
 * This is a whitelist rather than a blacklist on purpose. The set of shapes a legitimate profile
 * takes is small and known (the bundled profiles are the reference), while the set of harmful ones
 * is open-ended.
