/**
 * How XMB silhouette glyphs separate from the background — the PSP-style two-layer icon:
 * each glyph draws twice, a matte copy behind the glyph, so the icon hugs its own contour
 * instead of fogging the area around it (the way a blurred halo does).
 *
 * The matte must be the luminance OPPOSITE of the glyph: the theme's `iconColor` is not
 * always light (the motivating frame had a dark red glyph over a near-black sky, where a
 * dark matte adds nothing), which is why [CONTOUR_AUTO] derives the matte from the glyph's
 * own luminance. A hardcoded dark matte behind a dark glyph on dark wallpaper is invisible —
 * exactly the failure this setting exists to fix.
 *
 *  - [NONE]           today's rendering, unchanged — the shipped default.
 *  - [OFFSET_SHADOW]  one matte copy, offset down and to the right (a hard drop shadow).
 *  - [CONTOUR_DARK]   dark matte copies dilated all around the glyph.
 *  - [CONTOUR_LIGHT]  the same, with a light matte.
 *  - [CONTOUR_AUTO]   the same, matte color derived from the glyph's luminance.
