/**
 * How a game entity's XMB tile is drawn. [ICON0] is the PSP-authentic 144:80 edge-to-edge fill
 * (and the only mode that can play an ICON1 video snap IN THE TILE — see [VideoSnapPlacement],
 * whose background placement needs no tile and so plays in any mode); the other three render at
 * their artwork's natural aspect with the selection chrome hugging the fitted bounds. A game with no art for
 * its mode falls back toward the ICON0 look ([PHYSICAL_MEDIA] falls back to the bundled
 * per-platform cartridge/disc icon instead).
 *
 * Stored as the enum name: globally in DataStore, per-game in `games.icon_display_mode`
 * (null = follow the global setting).
