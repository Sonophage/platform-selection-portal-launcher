/**
 * Pins the motion-wallpaper freeze contract — the plan's central claim: **when the wave would be
 * frozen, the motion wallpaper is not merely paused, no decoder exists.** Every freeze input must
 * independently force [MotionWallpaperPolicy.Decision.POSTER], and only the all-clear case plays.
 *
 * The composable that consumes [MotionWallpaperPolicy] releases its ExoPlayer whenever the
 * decision is POSTER (leaving the motion branch), so these decisions are literally the difference
 * between "a codec is running" and "a JPEG on screen".
