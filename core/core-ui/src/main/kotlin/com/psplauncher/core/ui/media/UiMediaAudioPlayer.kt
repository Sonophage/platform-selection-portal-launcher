/**
 * One-shot ExoPlayer for presentation audio — [UiMediaSlot.BOOT_AUDIO] and the GameBoot
 * sequence's own sound, neither of which has a [MenuSound] because they are seconds of
 * presentation audio, not a UI sonification (the same reasoning that keeps `OneShotAudioLayer`
 * off SoundPool in the boot/GameBoot overlays).
 *
 * Two jobs share this one singleton:
 *
 *  1. **Auditioning** from the settings screens (its original, Boot-Sound-only role) — play the
 *     slot's assignment, or its bundled default, on demand: [play] with a [UiMediaSlot].
 *  2. **Presentation playback** for the GameBoot sequence — started before the first frame is
 *     drawn so a timeline measured against the sample stays in sync with it, and owned here
 *     rather than by the overlay so the drawing side can never release the player mid-clip.
 *     GameBoot has no slot of its own, so it uses [play] with an explicit URI.
 *
 * The slot form plays the user's assignment when one exists, otherwise the bundled default
 * resolved through [UiMediaSlot.bundledDefaultUri] — the same custom-over-default rule
 * [MenuSoundPlayer] applies to the menu sounds, kept here rather than in any feature screen so no
 * caller grows a URI branch.
 *
 * Singleton: settings screens come and go, and a preview player that died with its screen could
 * be cut off mid-note by a screen flip — and GameBoot's playback must outlive the launch call
 * that started it. One player for the app's lifetime, reused across plays, released on app
 * teardown with every other Hilt singleton.
