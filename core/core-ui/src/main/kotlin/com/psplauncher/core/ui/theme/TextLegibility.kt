/**
 * The launcher's WCAG contrast engine.
 *
 * Deliberately pure channel arithmetic on the sRGB values Compose stores — no android dependency —
 * so every rule here is pinned by plain JVM unit tests (`TextLegibilityTest`) rather than by
 * eyeballing a screenshot. It grew out of [deriveStorefrontColors]'s contrast floor and was
 * promoted here once the same math turned out to be needed by Settings, the XMB and the
 * font-color picker. See `docs/plans/text-legibility-font-color-plan.md`.
 *
 * Two facts drive everything below:
 *
 *  - White text needs a background whose relative luminance is **<= 0.183** to reach 4.5:1; black
 *    text needs **>= 0.175**. A backdrop that sweeps across that crossover down one screen cannot
 *    be served by any single text color.
 *  - A drop shadow adds a dark *edge* without changing the *fill* relationship, so it cannot
 *    rescue a fill whose ratio is structurally too low.

// -- Roles --------------------------------------------------------------------

/**
 * The contrast bar a text run has to clear, which is a property of its *size*, not of the screen.
 *
 * WCAG "large text" is 24sp regular or 18.66sp bold. Almost nothing in this app qualifies: the
 * settings rows are 15sp labels, 13sp values and 12sp sublabels, so they are [BODY]. Only the
 * XMB's 22sp SemiBold selected label is [LARGE]. A global 3:1 render bar would ratify exactly the
 * failure this engine exists to fix — 3:1 remains the *picker's* warning trigger, which is a
 * different question from what we are willing to render.

 * solution exists in at least one direction for any hue.
 *
 * Both directions are bisected and the winner is whichever lands *nearer* the original lightness —
 * not whichever maximises contrast, which would drive every choice to black and throw the hue away.
 *
 * **[maxShift] is what makes this a clamp rather than an override.** A solution always exists at
 * the poles — white passes on any background below L 0.183 and black on any above 0.175, and those
 * two ranges overlap — so an unbounded search would "succeed" by handing back near-black for a
 * bright yellow and call it the user's colour. Past [maxShift] the hue is no longer recognisable,
 * so the result comes back with `meetsTarget = false` and the caller escalates to a contrast
 * plate, which keeps the requested colour and moves the *background* instead.
