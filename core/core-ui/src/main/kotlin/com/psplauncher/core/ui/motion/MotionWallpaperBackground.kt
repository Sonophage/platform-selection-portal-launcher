/**
 * The motion-wallpaper layer: the poster still rendered underneath, with the looping video
 * (or animated GIF/WebP) composited above it once its first frame lands.
 *
 * Power discipline — this composable exists to implement one rule:
 *
 * > When the wave would be frozen, the motion wallpaper is not merely paused — no decoder exists.
 *
 *  • [decision] POSTER is honored by NOT composing this composable at all (the caller switches
 *    branches), so a frozen background holds neither a player nor a codec. The poster parameter
 *    is still rendered here for the PLAY paths, where it sits under the video until the first
 *    frame arrives (no black flash) and remains if decoding fails.
 *  • GIF/animated WebP never construct a player at all: they are a *separate composable*
 *    ([AnimatedImageSurface]), because ExoPlayer has no GIF extractor and a player built on one
 *    fails to sniff, logs a `Source error`, and holds a codec that can never render a frame.
 *  • ONE player, constructed per [motionPath] inside [MotionVideoSurface] — and only for real
 *    video — released — never paused — in [DisposableEffect.onDispose]. A paused ExoPlayer still
 *    holds a codec instance, a surface, and buffers.
 *  • Audio never decoded: the audio track is disabled at the track-selection level AND the
 *    volume is muted (the same two-belt approach as the ICON1 overlay). A wallpaper with sound
 *    would also fight the music player.
 *  • Loops forever (REPEAT_MODE_ALL) — a background loops by definition, which is why the
 *    import gate caps duration at 60 s.
 *  • TextureView, not SurfaceView: the layer sits under the whole Compose tree and must
 *    composite with the fade-in (a SurfaceView behind the window needs a punched-through hole
 *    in an opaque window and breaks the crossfade).
 *  • The app-visible gate is [rememberAppVisible], folded into the decision upstream, so
 *    backgrounding the launcher (every game launch) lands in POSTER and releases the player.

 * "a GIF wallpaper constructs no ExoPlayer" structural: no code path even builds the player for

 *
 * Coil decodes animated images honoring the file's OWN repeat metadata by default — a GIF whose
 * loop flag is absent (or 0) renders its first frame and stops, i.e. an animated image with
 * repeatCount 1 is visually a still. The request therefore carries an explicit infinite repeat
 * count (forcing a fresh animated decode that actually loops — the count rides the memory-cache
 * key, so it is a distinct decode from any still request of the same file). The caller only
 * routes non-POSTER decisions into this background, so the request is unconditional. (REDUCED is
 * a no-op here: there is no frame-rate knob; the video's 0.5f playback-speed analogue would be
 * arbitrary.) If the animated decode fails outright, this layer renders nothing and the poster
 * beneath is simply what shows — the same degradation a corrupt video gets.
