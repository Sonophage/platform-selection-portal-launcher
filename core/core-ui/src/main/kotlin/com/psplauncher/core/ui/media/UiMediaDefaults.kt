/**
 * The bundled default sample for each customizable slot — the ONE mapping from slot to the
 * `res/raw` asset that plays when the user has not assigned anything.
 *
 * Both consumers hang off this single function so the mapping cannot drift between them:
 * [com.psplauncher.core.ui.sound.MenuSoundPlayer] loads one SoundPool sample per DISTINCT
 * slot (Navigation's three events share `sfx_cursor` by construction, not by three copies), and
 * [bundledDefaultUri] hands ExoPlayer a URI for the AUDIO_TRACK slots that have a default.
 *
 * [UiMediaSlot.BOOT_AUDIO] is the only AUDIO_TRACK slot with a default — that is what makes Boot
 * Sound audible out of the box (before this, `bootAudioPath == null` meant silence). GameBoot has
 * no audio SLOT at all any more; its default sound is [gameBootDefaultAudioUri], which is not
 * user-assignable and so does not belong in this table. Video slots deliberately return null
 * forever: there is no bundled boot or GameBoot video and none should be added.
