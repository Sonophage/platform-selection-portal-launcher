 * consumer falls back to the built-in glyph, so pre-icon themes and presets render exactly
 * as before.
 *
 * Provided by XMBShell alongside LocalPFPColors; loaded by XMBViewModel from the extracted
 * theme-icons dir (see PfpThemeStore.apply). Deliberately a separate composition local from
 * [LocalCustomIcons] (precedence, and the theme-icons wipe on apply, are different concerns),
 * but the same value type — a v3 theme can carry a GIF just as a user pick can.

 * Custom icons draw as-authored (untinted) — like PSP themes, their colors are baked by
 * the theme author; the unified icon tint keeps applying to non-overridden defaults. When
 * an icon-legibility style is configured, a matte drawn from the bitmap's own alpha sits
 * BEHIND the as-authored art (override branch, [OverrideGlyphSurface]), and the default
 * vector branch carries the same matte ([VectorGlyphSurface]) — which is how the setting
 * reaches the main XMB item column's Material-glyph rows.
