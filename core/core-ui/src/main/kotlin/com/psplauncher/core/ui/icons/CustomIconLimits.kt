/**
 * Import gate for user-picked custom XMB icons, mirroring MotionLimits: the gate runs
 * BEFORE anything is copied, and every rejection names its reason. Every number is a judgment
 * call living in one object so tuning later is a one-file change.
 *
 * The still/animated asymmetry is deliberate: oversized STILLS are downscaled by
 * SafeMedia.decodeFileCapped(targetDimension = [MAX_DIMENSION]) at import, never rejected;
 * oversized GIFs are rejected with a message — re-encoding a GIF is out of scope.
 *
 * Tested by CustomIconLimitsTest, including the boundary at each cap.
