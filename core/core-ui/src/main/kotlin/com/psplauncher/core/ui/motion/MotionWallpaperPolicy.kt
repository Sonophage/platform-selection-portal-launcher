/**
 * Pure decision for whether a user-supplied motion wallpaper (looping MP4/WebM/GIF behind the
 * XMB) plays, plays slowed, or renders its poster still. The governing rule it encodes:
 *
 * > When the wave would be frozen, the motion wallpaper is not merely paused — no decoder exists.
 *
 * `WaveStyle.STATIC` never starts the wave's frame loop; the motion equivalent is that POSTER
 * never constructs an ExoPlayer (a paused player still holds a codec instance, a surface, and
 * buffers — precisely the cost a launcher must not pay while a game is about to launch). The
 * composable that consumes this policy releases its player whenever the decision is POSTER.
 *
 * Tested by MotionWallpaperPolicyTest, which pins the whole matrix.
