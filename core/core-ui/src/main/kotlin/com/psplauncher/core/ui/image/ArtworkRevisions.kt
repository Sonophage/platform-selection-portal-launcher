/**
 * A revision number per artwork URI, bumped whenever that URI's bytes are replaced in place.
 *
 * Evicting Coil's cache is not enough on its own. A portable-library write keeps the same file
 * name, so the same document URI, so the game column holds the same string: every `AsyncImage`
 * already showing it sees an unchanged model and never asks again. It keeps the old bitmap until
 * it leaves composition. Reading the revision here is what makes a composable recompose when the
 * bytes behind its URI change.
 *
 * Snapshot state in a process-wide object rather than an injected class, because the readers are
 * dozens of composables across modules that have no ViewModel path to a singleton. It holds
 * display bookkeeping only; nothing is persisted.
