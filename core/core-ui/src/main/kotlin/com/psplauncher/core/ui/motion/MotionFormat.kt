 * Which decoder a stored motion file needs. The extension is authoritative: the importer names
 * every file `wallpaper_<stamp>.<ext>` from the validated MIME (DisplaySettingsViewModel), so the
 * suffix IS the MIME by construction and no probe is needed at render time.
 *
 * The caps and the import gate itself no longer live here — they moved to
 * [com.psplauncher.themekit.MotionLimits] so the desktop Theme Studio, which authors motion
 * wallpapers of its own, validates against the same numbers instead of a second copy that drifts.
 * What remains is the part that is genuinely render-side and Android-only.
