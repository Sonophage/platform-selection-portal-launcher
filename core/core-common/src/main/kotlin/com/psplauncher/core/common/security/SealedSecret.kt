 * The outcome of sealing a secret for storage.

 * Sealing can fail — a device whose Keystore is unavailable, or a key that was invalidated — and

 * implemented by silently returning the plaintext, which meant a credential could be stored
 * unprotected with nothing anywhere saying so. This type keeps the same behaviour (the value is
 * always stored) while making the difference impossible to drop on the floor: a caller that wants
 * to warn the user can, and a caller that does not still has to acknowledge the type.
