/**
 * Hardens externally-supplied launch intents (captured `INSTALL_SHORTCUT` broadcasts) before PFP
 * stores or starts them.
 *
 * PFP is a privileged deputy: it holds broad storage access and owns a FileProvider that can grant
 * read access to files under /storage. A malicious app could broadcast a crafted shortcut whose
 * intent carries a `content://` URI for one of those files plus `FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION`,
 * tricking PFP into granting the attacker read access when the user later taps the entry
 * (confused-deputy / intent-redirection → arbitrary file read).
 *
 * [sanitize] neutralizes that by stripping every URI-permission grant flag and any ClipData, and by
 * pinning the intent to a concrete installed component so it can't be implicitly redirected. The
 * action/extras a legitimate game shortcut needs are preserved.
