 * material never leaves secure hardware, so even on a rooted device the stored DataStore value is
 * not directly usable. Stored form is Base64(iv ‖ ciphertext).
 *
 * [decryptOrLegacy] returns the original string when decryption fails, so values written before
 * encryption was introduced (plain text) keep working until they're next saved (and re-encrypted).
 *
 * [seal] reports whether sealing actually succeeded. Keystore failure still stores the user's
 * input rather than losing it, but it comes back as [SealedSecret.Unprotected] so the caller can
 * tell the user their credential is not encrypted at rest — the previous behaviour returned a bare
 * String and that outcome was invisible.
