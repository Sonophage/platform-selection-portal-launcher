/**
 * The Studio previews every slot the launcher customizes; a slot added to [CustomizableIcons]
 * without Studio art would silently render [StudioIconSet.defaultPainter]'s play-arrow stand-in.
 * This is the same guard `DefaultSlotGlyphTest` provides on the launcher side: the build fails
 * here instead of the gap shipping.
 *
 * Guards COVERAGE (key sets) only — the two modules share just pure-JVM theme-kit, so the
 * glyph VALUES cannot be cross-checked here; keeping a vector in lockstep with the launcher's
 * render site stays a review concern.
