/**
 * Accepts a user-picked video as a motion wallpaper: validates it, and lifts its first frame out
 * as the still poster.
 *
 * ## Why the video is not converted
 *
 * An earlier design transcoded the pick to GIF "for performance". It is worth recording that this
 * was backwards, because the instinct is a common one. On device, [com.psplauncher.core.ui.motion.formatOf]
 * routes `.mp4` to ExoPlayer — a hardware decoder — and `.gif` to Coil's `MovieDrawable`, which
 * decodes on the CPU and holds every frame as a bitmap. For the same clip the MP4 is roughly a
 * tenth the size AND cheaper per frame. Transcoding would have spent real effort to produce the
 * worse artifact. The video is passed through untouched, and the launcher plays it the fast way.
 *
 * ## What passing through costs, stated plainly
 *
 * The user's original container bytes ship inside the theme and are parsed on someone else's
 * device by MediaCodec — a native decoder with a long CVE history. Re-encoding from pixels would
 * have severed that, and it is the one genuine advantage the transcode had.
 *
 * It is not a new hole. `DisplaySettingsViewModel` already lets anyone import an arbitrary MP4 as
 * a motion wallpaper, and themes already carry attacker-controlled bytes as wallpapers and icons.
 * This uses the existing exposure rather than widening it. What it does mean is that the checks
 * below are not a formality: `PfpThemeStore.apply()` installs a bundle's motion entry without
 * re-running [MotionLimits.validate], so for a Studio-authored theme **this is the only gate
 * there is**, and a bad pick must fail here on the desktop rather than on someone's handheld.
 *
 * ## Why JCodec is still here
 *
 * Only for the poster, and only ever for one frame. The launcher enforces "motion is never set
 * without its poster" ([com.psplauncher.core.ui.motion.MotionWallpaperPolicy] renders the
 * still whenever no decoder may exist), and `PfpThemeStore.apply()` maps the bundle's *still
 * wallpaper* onto that poster key — so a bundle carrying motion and no still is an invalid theme.
 * When the user imports only a video, frame 1 becomes the still. Pure Java, MP4/H.264 only; a
 * hostile stream gets an exception rather than the native overflow a C decoder would risk.
