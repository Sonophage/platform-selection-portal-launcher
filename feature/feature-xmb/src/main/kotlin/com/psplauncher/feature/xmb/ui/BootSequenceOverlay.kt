/**
 * The PSP-style startup presentation, optionally replaced by the user's own video and/or audio.
 *
 * **Historical note.** This file used to carry a rule that boot must NEVER play the user's video —
 * boot being the most contended moment on the device. The project owner reversed that decision;
 * custom boot media is now a supported feature. The reversal is only safe because of the guard
 * rails that replaced the rule, and it is off again if any of them is removed:
 *
 *  1. The import gate caps a boot clip at 10 s and 25 MB, and rejects a file whose duration cannot
 *     be read at all (a file we cannot time is a file we cannot bound).
 *  2. The media item is clipped to the same cap in the pipeline, so the decoder itself stops.
 *  3. [HARD_CAP_MS] is a watchdog that does not consult the players: on timeout the boot completes
 *     regardless of what any of them is doing.
 *  4. A player error completes the presentation immediately; a video that will not decode falls
 *     back to the built-in logo animation rather than to a black screen.
 *  5. [onComplete] fires EXACTLY once across natural end, skip, error, and timeout.
 *
 * Boot still does not play the user's MOTION WALLPAPER — that restriction is unrelated to this
 * reversal and stays. [XmbBackground] is composed without wallpaper args on purpose.
 *
 * The four combinations (default/custom × video/audio) all work. [bootVideoPath] null means the
 * built-in logo animation. [bootAudioPath] is what XMBViewModel resolved via `resolveBootAudio`:
 * the user's boot sound, else the bundled opening chime ONLY when there is no custom video, else
 * null (a custom video keeps its own audio track). So a non-null [bootAudioPath] still means
 * "mute the clip and play this instead" — the ViewModel guarantees it is never the bundled chime
 * stacked under a custom video. There is no bundled boot .mp4 and none should be added.
