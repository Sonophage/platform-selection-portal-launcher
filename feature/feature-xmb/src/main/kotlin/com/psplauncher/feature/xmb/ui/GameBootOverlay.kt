/**
 * The short PSP-style presentation between confirming a game and the emulator taking the screen.
 *
 * Same shape as [BootSequenceOverlay] — one-shot players released on dispose — but with a tighter
 * budget: the emulator is waiting. Two properties matter more here than anywhere else in the app:
 *
 *  • **It always ends.** [HARD_CAP_MS] completes the presentation regardless of player state, and
 *    [GameBootGate] has its own, slightly longer, timeout behind this one. A stuck presentation
 *    costs seconds, never the launch.
 *  • **It only draws — the audio is not owned here.** The gate (or, for a settings preview, the
 *    XMB ViewModel) starts the GameBoot sound through
 *    [com.psplauncher.core.ui.media.UiMediaAudioPlayer] before this overlay composes, so the
 *    sound is already running when the first frame lands and this composable can never release it
 *    mid-clip. The only audio it ever plays itself is a custom VIDEO's own track; that one ends
 *    with the clip, never mid-note.
 *
 * Audio does NOT go through MenuSoundPlayer, so muting menu sounds cannot silence it. That is the
 * design's "mute must not silence GameBoot" rule satisfied structurally rather than by a check.
 *
 * GameBoot is ONE thing with one switch. With no custom video, [GameBootSequence] draws the
 * built-in PSP-style light sweep (motion-budget aware via [waveStyle]) against the bundled launch
 * sound; assign a video and it replaces the whole presentation, sound included. The gate has
 * already decided which of the two is playing by the time this composes, so there is no fallback
 * branch here.
