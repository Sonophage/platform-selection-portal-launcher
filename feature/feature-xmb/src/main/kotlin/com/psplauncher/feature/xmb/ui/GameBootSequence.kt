/**
 * The built-in GameBoot presentation — a PSP-style light sweep drawn in Compose, beat-matched to
 * the bundled launch sound over its full 2.000 s.
 *
 * This is GameBoot's default, and deliberately NOT a bundled video: it is drawn on a surface that
 * is already live, so it costs no decoder warm-up at the one moment the user is waiting for their
 * game, it scales to any screen, it picks up the user's theme colours, and it can drop its motion
 * without dropping its timing — none of which a shipped MP4 could do. A user who wants something
 * else assigns their own clip, and [GameBootOverlay] plays that instead, with its own audio.
 *
 * **Real time, not animation time.** The timeline is driven by [withFrameMillis] deltas rather
 * than an `Animatable` + `tween`, because tween durations are scaled by the system's animator
 * duration setting: with animations turned down (developer options, or a battery/accessibility
 * profile) a tween-driven sequence finishes early or instantly, the gate's await returns, and the
 * emulator takes the screen while the sound is still playing. Frame deltas are wall-clock, so
 * two seconds is two seconds and the light stays locked to the sample it was measured from.
 *
 * **Motion budget: less motion, not less time.** [BootSequenceOverlay] hardcodes
 * `WaveStyle.ANIMATED` because it runs once per app start. GameBoot runs on EVERY launch, so it
 * honors the user's wave style instead — a deliberate deviation from BootSequenceOverlay's stance.
 * A frozen or reduced style replaces the bloom and both sweeps with one still frame, but the
 * presentation still runs its full length. Shortening it instead would end the visual while the
 * sound was still going and hand the screen to the emulator mid-presentation, which is the one
 * thing this sequence must not do.
