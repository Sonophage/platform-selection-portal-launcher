 * How a game launch settled, recorded once the outcome is known (B1 — launch reliability).
 *
 * The three-way split mirrors the plan's failure model:
 * - [SUCCEEDED]: the launcher was backgrounded for a real session and the user returned normally.
 * - [NEVER_FOREGROUNDED]: startActivity succeeded but the emulator never took the foreground
 *   (nothing covered the launcher inside the window) or the user was back almost immediately —
 *   the signature of an instant crash, a black screen the user escaped, or a refused hand-off.
 * - [INTENT_FAILED]: startActivity itself threw (ActivityNotFound, SecurityException, …).
