/**
 * The seam between "the launch is going to happen" and "the emulator has the screen".
 *
 * [LaunchDispatcher.launch] awaits this immediately before `startActivity`, so the presentation
 * only ever plays for a launch that has already passed every preflight — a game that cannot start
 * never shows a GameBoot. The XMB shell observes [active] and composes the overlay; when the
 * overlay finishes (or is skipped) it calls [onPresentationFinished] and the launch proceeds.
 *
 * **The user can never be trapped here.** [awaitPresentation] is bounded by [TIMEOUT_MS] and a
 * timeout PROCEEDS with the launch rather than throwing — a stuck presentation costs the user
 * eight seconds, not their game.
 *
 * **One GameBoot, one switch, one asset.** GameBoot is either on or off ([GameBootPreferences]),
 * and when it is on the user either keeps the built-in five-second sequence or replaces the whole
 * thing with a clip of their own — there is no separate sound to assign, which is why
 * [resolveGameBootAudio] has only two branches: the built-in sound plays under the built-in
 * sequence, and a custom clip is left to its own track.
 *
 * **The launch waits for the whole presentation.** [awaitPresentation] does not return until the
 * overlay reports back, and the built-in sequence runs its full five seconds in every case — the
 * motion budget drops its motion, not its length — so the emulator never takes the screen partway
 * through. The audio is started here rather than by the overlay only so it begins before the first
 * frame is drawn and stays in sync with a timeline that was measured against it; the overlay is
 * draw-only and can never release the player mid-clip.
