// architecture generation (manifest-verified 2026-07-16, live-fired on both installed variants;
// V5 id namespaces live-fired on Ludashi 5.1.7, 2026-07-18):
//   V6: -n <pkg>/com.xiaoji.egggame.DeepLinkActivity (the documented Beacon/ES-DE recipe)
//   V5: -n <pkg>/com.xj.landscape.launcher.ui.gamedetail.GameDetailActivity (exported)
// with --es steamAppId|localGameId <id> --ez autoStartGame true either way.
//
// Two id namespaces exist and do not overlap:
//   local_<uuid>  — manually added local EXEs (shown with a Copy button on the game's page);
//                   launches via localGameId with the string passed through verbatim.
//   numeric       — Steam-matched installs address by steamAppId; launcher-local integer ids
//                   (Banner Tools → Show Game ID) address by localGameId. On V5 the wrong
//                   namespace opens an empty "Get Game" stub, so numeric ids are sent as BOTH
//                   extras — the launcher resolves whichever matches (steam wins, live-fired).
//                   V6 keeps localGameId-only, its proven contract.
