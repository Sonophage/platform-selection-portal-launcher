 * tier, so a core can never overtake a console's core just because detection order changed when
 * another core was installed or removed. Standalones stay preferred ahead of it, and every other
 * profile keeps its relative order.

 * unchanged — the core is genuinely gone, so the fallback picks normally and the record is
