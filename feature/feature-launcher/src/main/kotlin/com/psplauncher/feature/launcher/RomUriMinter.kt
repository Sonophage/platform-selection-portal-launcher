 * not cover removable volumes and a launch from an SD card fails outright without it. That root is
 * far wider than any caller needs: every launch resolves a file belonging to a configured Memory
 * Card, never an arbitrary path. Nothing enforced the narrower rule, and the package that receives
 * `grantUriPermission(...)` comes from an emulator profile — which a restored backup can supply.
 *
 * This module is the enforcement point. The provider stays broad because XML cannot express
 * "somewhere under /storage, except other apps' data directories"; the rule lives here instead,
 * where it can consult what the user actually configured. Callers get a URI or nothing.
