/**
 * The one full "scan the ROM root" pass — walks every granted root's top-level subfolders, maps
 * each to a platform by its ES-DE folder name, auto-creates a Memory Card for any system that
 * doesn't have one yet, then scans every discovered console plus the shared PC import pass.
 * Extracted from [LibraryManagerViewModel] so the first-run wizard's ROM-root pick can trigger
 * the exact same auto-detect + scan without duplicating this ~120-line loop.
 *
 * Mirrors [PcGameScanner]: a `@Singleton` returning a summary report with a ready-made message.
 * Both the Library Manager and the setup wizard call in here instead of keeping their own copy
 * of this loop — the wizard otherwise persisted a root but never scanned it, so wizard-configured
 * consoles stayed empty until the user found Auto-Detect in Settings.
