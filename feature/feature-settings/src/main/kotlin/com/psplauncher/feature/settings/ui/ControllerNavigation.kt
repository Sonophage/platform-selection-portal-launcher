 * Settings adapter for the unified navigation core (Phase 2—3 of the migration).
 *
 * This class drives a core [NavigationEngine] — cycling one [com.psplauncher.core.navigation.NavigationContext]
 * per screen — while preserving Settings' legacy public surface ([updateItems], [move],
 * [moveHorizontal], [focusFirst], [setFocused], [select], [focusedKey]) so the scaffold and its
 * tests keep working unchanged.
 *
 * Ownership stays with the core: stable-key focus preservation, nearest-survivor recovery
 * (visual geometry → order fallback), no-wrap clamping and inline-action traversal all come
 * from the engine. This class only translates between Settings rows and generic nodes.
