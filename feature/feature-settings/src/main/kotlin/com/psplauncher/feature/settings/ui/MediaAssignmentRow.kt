 * One user-media assignment row: what it is, what is currently assigned, and the two
 * controller-reachable actions that act on it. Selecting the row opens the system picker.
 *
 * Extracted from Interface ▸ Sound so Display ▸ Boot Sequence and Display ▸ GameBoot are the SAME
 * row rather than a copy of it — the three screens differ only in which slot they hand it. A user
 * who has learned the shortcuts on one screen already knows them on the others.
 *
 * [onUseDefault]'s action only appears while something custom is assigned: an action that would do
 * nothing is worse than no action for controller navigation, which has to step through every one.
 * [onPreview] is always offered, because previewing the bundled default is exactly how a user
 * decides whether they want to replace it.

/**

 * Xbox/PS pads, X on Nintendo) resets the row to the PFP default, and the **west**-facing button
 * (X on Xbox/PS, Y on Nintendo) plays its preview. Neither button has another role on the screens
 * that use these rows, so no layout can collide with one.
 *
 * Mechanically: XMBViewModel forwards both presses into the settings layer as
 * OPEN_CONTEXT_MENU / CHANGE_SORT ("treated identically", per its own comment), and these map them
 * back to physical positions through the user's [XYLayout]. Kept here beside the row so the three
 * screens using it cannot drift into different bindings.
