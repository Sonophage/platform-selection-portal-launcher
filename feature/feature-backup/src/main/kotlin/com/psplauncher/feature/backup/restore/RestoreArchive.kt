/**
 * The trust seam for `.pfpbackup` restore.
 *
 * A backup file is untrusted input that reaches further than anything else the app opens: it
 * writes into `filesDir` and it supplies emulator profiles, which choose the `ComponentName` an
 * intent is aimed at and whose package later receives `grantUriPermission(...)` for a ROM.
 *
 * The confinement policy used to exist as a comment and a delete loop rather than as an enforced
 * interface: `BUNDLED_FILE_ROOTS` was used only to clear directories, and the copy that followed
 * resolved `File(filesDir, rel)` with `rel` never checked against those roots. Anything under
 * `filesDir` was therefore writable — including the DataStore preference file, which corrupts the
 * live preference store into a crash loop.
 *
 * Here the invariants live in one module and callers cannot opt out of them: an entry that is not
 * under a declared root never reaches staging, so [RestoredBundle.commitFiles] has nothing unsafe
 * left to copy. Bounds come from [BoundedZipReader], but NOT with its defaults: those are sized
 * for a `.pfptheme` from a stranger, and a real library's backup is thousands of files and
 * gigabytes. Callers pass [com.psplauncher.feature.backup.BACKUP_ZIP_LIMITS]; the default
 * parameter here stays theme-sized so a caller that forgets is refused loudly rather than
 * unbounded.
