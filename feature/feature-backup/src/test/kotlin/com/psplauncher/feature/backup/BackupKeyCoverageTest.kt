/**
 * BackupManager carries preferences by an explicit key list, so a key that is not named there
 * simply does not survive a restore — with no error, no log line and nothing to notice until a
 * user finds a setting missing on a new device. This test is the tripwire.
 *
 * Every key below was verified against its declaration site. Keys deliberately NOT carried are
 * listed at the bottom with the reason, so an omission reads as a decision rather than an
 * oversight.
