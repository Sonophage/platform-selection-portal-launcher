/**
 * Which games one library file belongs to during Scan & Relink, strongest evidence first. Pure, so
 * the order is testable without a folder or a database.
 *
 * 0. **Durable identity** (C16 task D.3): the library's identity index says which game's ids this
 *    file was written for, and one of those ids names a game that still exists. This is the only
 *    tier that survives a renamed ROM, which is why it goes first — every tier below it is a way of
 *    guessing from a name, and a name is exactly what a rename changes.
 * 1. A **claim** on the file's full stem: the name a `.pfpgame` export says this game's artwork was
 *    saved under (C18 task X.5). It is the user's own record of the name, so it outranks everything.
 * 2. An existing **record** with that portable name: anything PFP itself wrote reconnects exactly.
 * 3. For a multi-asset kind, a claim on the **ordinal-stripped base** (`Name_01` → `Name`). Still
 *    exact evidence, so it outranks the fuzzy matcher below.
 * 4. The **fuzzy matcher** on the full file name, for foreign files.
 * 5. A record, then the fuzzy matcher, on the base.
 *
 * With no identity and no claims this is exactly the order relink used before: record, fuzzy, record
 * on the base, fuzzy on the base — so a library written before D.2, or a foreign ES-DE drop that PFP
 * never wrote, behaves exactly as it always has. The full stem is always tried before the base, so a ROM whose own name ends in
 * `_07` is never mistaken for another game's seventh screenshot (C16 task 0.4).
