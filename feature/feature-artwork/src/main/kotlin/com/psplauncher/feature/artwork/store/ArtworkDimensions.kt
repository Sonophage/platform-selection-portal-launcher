 *
 * The rule, in one line: **use the artwork's real dimensions when PFP knows them, and this table
 * only when it does not.** [boxArtAspect] encodes that ordering; [boxArt] is the preset alone, for
 * the placeholder path where source dimensions are absent by definition.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT the crop registry's platform tier ([CropProfileRegistry]). That resolves
 * *platform beats source*, which is right for a fixed crop target like ICON0 and wrong for box art
 * — so box art's platform rows live here and the registry's box-art platform tier stays empty.
