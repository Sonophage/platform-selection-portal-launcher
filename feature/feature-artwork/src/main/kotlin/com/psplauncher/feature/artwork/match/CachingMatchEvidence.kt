/**
 * Remembers title searches, and shares any search still in flight.
 *
 * The matcher re-runs Tier 3 on every source switch, tab switch and search, and the picker searches
 * the same titles again. ScreenScraper serves this account one request at a time, about three
 * seconds for a platform search and ten for every platform, so each repeat queued behind the last.
 * Now a search is asked once: a caller that arrives while it runs waits for the same answer, and a
 * later caller gets it from memory. Only title searches are remembered; the other lookups pass
 * straight through.
 *
 * Memory lasts one Studio open ([clear]). Behind it, [store] keeps answers between opens (AD-21):
 * an answer with hits for [HITS_TTL_MS], and ScreenScraper's empty answer for [SCREENSCRAPER_EMPTY_TTL_MS].
 * ScreenScraper throws when a search fails, so its empty answer is a real one, but a game it adds
 * later should not stay hidden for a week. The other providers still report a failure as an empty
 * list, so their empty answers are never kept, and a failure is never remembered anywhere.
