/**
 * Orders the files linked to one multi-asset (game, kind) slot during Scan & Relink (D1, C21 task
 * 1.5). A delete or reorder renumbers a slot's record positions without renaming its files, so the
 * filename's ordinal and a record's `sort_order` can disagree after either — a file must keep its
 * OWN record's relative order, never inherit whichever record happens to sit at its ordinal today.
 *
 * A file with a prior record — matched by portable name — keeps that record's relative order; a
 * file with no prior record (foreign, or a fresh library with no records at all) sorts after them,
 * by its filename ordinal (`ArtworkFileNaming.ordinalOf`). The caller assigns final positions
 * `0..n-1` from this order.
 *
 * Pure, so the ordering is testable without a folder, a database, or relink's own walk.
