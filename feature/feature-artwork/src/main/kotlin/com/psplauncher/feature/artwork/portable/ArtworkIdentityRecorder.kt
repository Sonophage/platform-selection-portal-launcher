/**
 * Collects durable identity for library files and writes it **once per operation** (C16 task D.2).
 *
 * `RoutingArtworkStore.persistPortable` runs once per artwork file, and the index is a single
 * document at the library root — so writing on every save would rewrite the whole file eight times
 * for one eight-kind scrape, over SAF, on an SD card. Recording is therefore an in-memory upsert
 * and [flush] is the only thing that touches the folder.
 *
 * **The only writer (task 1.4 / D2).** This is the sole owner of `pfp-artwork-identity.json`; no
 * other code calls [PortableArtworkLibrary.readIdentityIndex] or
 * [PortableArtworkLibrary.writeIdentityIndex]. `ArtworkImportManager.relinkLibrary` reads through
 * [current] and writes through [recordAll] + [flush], the same as any other caller — [flush] is
 * called at the end of an import (`ArtworkImportExecutor`) **and** at the end of a relink.
 *
 * **What happens to unflushed rows.** They are lost if the process dies first. That is acceptable
 * rather than merely tolerated: D.4's backfill rebuilds the index from `artwork_records` on the
 * next relink, so the worst case is that identity is one relink behind, not that it is wrong.
 *
 * The in-memory copy is the folder's, merged — [record] loads the existing index before its first
 * upsert, so a flush never drops rows another session wrote.
 *
 * **Tri-state per tree (task 1.3 / D3).** [folderIndex] is the last index this recorder could
 * actually read for the tree — either what [PortableArtworkLibrary.readIdentityIndex] loaded, or
 * empty when the folder had none yet ([PortableArtworkLibrary.IdentityIndexRead.Absent]). While the
 * folder's file is [PortableArtworkLibrary.IdentityIndexRead.Unreadable], [folderIndex] is left
 * untouched (never reset to empty), [record] keeps buffering into [recorded], and [flush] refuses
 * to write and returns false — an index the app cannot read must never be overwritten. Every
 * [ensureLoaded] call while unreadable retries the read, so a transient failure (or a rewrite by a
 * newer app version going away) heals on the next operation. On a read that recovers, the newly
 * loaded folder content is merged with whatever was buffered in the meantime, so nothing recorded
 * while unreadable is lost.
