/**
 * `pfp-artwork-identity.json` at the root of the artwork folder: which game each library file
 * belongs to, stated as durable identity rather than as a name (C16 task D.1).
 *
 * **Why this exists.** Artwork identity has been spelled as a filename at every tier —
 * `ArtworkKeyFactory` mints a ROM game's "stable, portable identity" as
 * `rom/{platform}/{slug(rom filename stem)}`, and all four tiers of `RelinkOwnerLookup` match on
 * names. A renamed ROM therefore orphans its artwork, and a `.pfpgame` export that carries real
 * scraper ids still reconnects by name.
 *
 * **This is not a new idea.** The v1 layout's per-entry `metadata.json` ([ArtworkEntryMetadata])
 * already carried `rom_crc32` and the scraper ids as "identity evidence the reconnect matcher uses
 * when the primary key misses (renamed ROM)". The v1→v2 migration moved the assets into the flat
 * media-dir layout and deleted that file, and nothing has written identity since. The serialized
 * names here are deliberately the same ones, so the evidence means the same thing it always did.
 *
 * **Why one file at the root** (user decision, 2026-09-16): one read per relink and one rewrite per
 * operation, invisible to ES-DE, which shares the folder. The accepted cost is that a file the user
 * hand-moves between platform folders leaves a stale row — relink then falls back to the name tiers
 * for it, exactly as it does today.
 *
 * Parsed defensively like the manifest: unknown keys ignored, malformed JSON → null. A future
 * `format_version` is also read as null (task 1.3 / D3) — a v2 file must not be silently rewritten
 * as v1. Individual bad rows inside an otherwise-readable document are dropped (and counted), not
 * fatal to the whole document. A corrupted index costs the library its durable identity for one
 * scan, never its artwork.
