/**
 * The artwork asset kinds a game can have. Each maps to the well-known filename the scraper
 * writes ([ArtworkFileNaming.fixedName]) and the prefix manual picks version under.
 * MANUAL/VIDEO/ICON1 are ScreenScraper-only extras (PDF manual, full video, icon snap) — stored
 * like any other asset but never referenced from game columns; their paths derive from names.
 *
 * VIDEO is the full gameplay video (Game Detail media strip); ICON1 is the short muted snap
 * played in the XMB icon slot (PSP ICON1.PMF). They are distinct: ICON1 is generated from a
 * full video when ScreenScraper has no ready-made normalized snap — the full video is always
 * kept untouched as VIDEO.

/**
 * The single place artwork bytes are saved, validated, and deleted.
 *
 * Callers (scraper, detail-screen pickers) never build filenames or paths — they hand the store
 * a source (URL or SAF uri) and persist the returned reference string on the game row. The
 * reference is whatever the active storage backend wants the UI to load (today: an absolute
 * internal file path; later: a portable content:// document URI).
 *
 * Two save families:
 *  • [saveFromUrl] — scraper path. Fixed per-kind filename, overwritten in place.
 *  • [saveVersionedFromUrl] / [saveVersionedFromUri] — user picks. A fresh timestamped filename
 *    on every save is what makes the change visible immediately (the DB row, Compose keys, and
 *    Coil's cache key all follow the path string); older files of the same kind are pruned so
 *    versions never accumulate. The prune runs before the caller updates the DB row, so there is
 *    a brief window where the row still names the just-deleted previous file — harmless and
 *    self-healing (stale refs are detected by [isValidRef] and re-scraped).
