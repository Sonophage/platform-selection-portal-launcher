/**
 * The single owner of Coil's display caches for artwork: it installs the app's configured
 * [ImageLoader] as Coil's singleton, and it is the only thing that evicts from or clears it.
 *
 * Those two jobs live together deliberately. `AsyncImage` and `Context.imageLoader` always resolve
 * through Coil's singleton, which — until something installs one — is a default loader with a
 * default disk cache. This app configures its own loader in [ArtworkModule] (512 MB cache under
 * `artwork_cache`) and injects it, but never installed it, so displaying went through Coil's
 * default loader while evicting went through the configured one. Re-scraped art kept serving the
 * old bytes from the path-keyed cache, "clear artwork cache" freed nothing the UI was reading, and
 * the reported cache size measured a cache nothing displayed from.
 *
 * Keeping the factory and the eviction calls in one class is what stops them drifting apart again:
 * there is no longer a second loader for a caller to reach for.
