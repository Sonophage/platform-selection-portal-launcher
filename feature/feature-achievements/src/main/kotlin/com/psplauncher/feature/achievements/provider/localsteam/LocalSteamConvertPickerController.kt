/**
 * Drives the "convert detected games?" multi-select picker shared by every scan surface (the XMB
 * Windows card and the Library Manager). A scan hands it the folders that carry a
 * `steam_settings/steam_appid.txt` but no `achievements.json` yet; the UI shows them all at once
 * with a checkbox each (every row pre-checked), and on confirm the selected games are converted
 * through [LocalSteamSchemaGenerator] in one batch.
 *
 * Framework-agnostic: it exposes a [picker] StateFlow the screens render a dialog from, so the same
 * controller and dialog serve both surfaces. Owned per ViewModel (constructed with the ViewModel's
 * scope), never a singleton. Replaces the retired per-game LocalSteamSchemaPromptController.
