/**
 * The user's own Steam Community achievements page (steamcommunity.com). This is the only place
 * Steam exposes the descriptions of hidden achievements the user has EARNED — the Web API withholds
 * them permanently, even after unlock — so the sync reads the user's own public page to fill that
 * gap.
 *
 * Security posture: the URL carries only the public SteamID64 (never a key), the host is
 * Valve-owned over HTTPS, the response is treated strictly as untrusted display text (see
 * [SteamCommunityAchievementsParser]), and any failure leaves the coins exactly as the Web API
 * returned them.
