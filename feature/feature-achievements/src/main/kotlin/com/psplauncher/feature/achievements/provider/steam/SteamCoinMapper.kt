/**
 * Maps a game's Steam schema + global rarity + the player's earned state to [SyncedCoin]s.
 * Standalone so the tier rules are unit-testable against plain DTOs.
 *
 * Steam tier rules (PFP's classification — Steam has no medal tiers of its own):
 *  - A confirmed **completion achievement** ("earn all other achievements") is the game's
 *    Platinum, regardless of its own rarity. Detection order: the verified
 *    [SteamPlatinumOverrides] table first, then strict phrase matching on the DESCRIPTION only —
 *    names like "Platinum" / "Completionist" / "100%" alone never qualify, since they can describe
 *    unrelated challenges. The Platinum coin is excluded from the Bronze/Silver/Gold tallies and
 *    the progress denominator, and earning it lights the mastery crown (see
 *    AchievementRepository.summaryOf). Games with no completion achievement still mint a synthetic
 *    Platinum on 100% completion.
 *  - Everything else tiers purely by global unlock rarity ([ShibaTier.forRarity]): Gold under 10%,
 *    Silver 10-24.99%, Bronze at 25% and above. Hidden achievements get no special tier — hidden
 *    does not mean rare.
 *  - A coin Steam reports no percentage for is Bronze with its rarity stored as
 *    [SyncedCoin.RARITY_UNAVAILABLE] so the UI can say so; an exact 0% with valid data is real
 *    ultra-rarity (Gold).
