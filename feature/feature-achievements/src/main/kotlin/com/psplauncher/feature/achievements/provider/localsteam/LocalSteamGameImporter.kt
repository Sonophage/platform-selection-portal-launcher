 * Reconciles the emu game folders [LocalSteamDiscovery] finds with the LIBRARY — it never

 * a launchable handle (pin / export / Add by ID). A folder that maps onto an existing game
 * links LOCAL_STEAM with the folder's appid and gets its ownership classified; an unmapped
 * folder simply stays a TRACKED local game, synced into Shiba Coins as an account-style entry
 * by the hub's Sync All (see `AchievementRepository.syncAllLinked`).
 *
 * Mapping is the shortcut-to-folder join (docs/windows-library-refactor-plan.md Phase 5):
 * normalized title first, then the STEAM-NAME BRIDGE — the appid's official store name matched
 * the same way — which survives renamed folders. No fuzzy matching, ever.
