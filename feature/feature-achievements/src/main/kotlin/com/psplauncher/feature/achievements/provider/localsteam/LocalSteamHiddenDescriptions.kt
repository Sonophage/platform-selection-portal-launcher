/**
 * Fills the descriptions of EARNED hidden achievements on emu (LOCAL_STEAM) games — the one field
 * the Steam Web API withholds permanently. The STEAM provider reads these off the user's OWN
 * community page ([com.psplauncher.feature.achievements.provider.steam.SteamRemoteDataSource]),
 * but an emu game isn't owned, so that page doesn't exist. Instead this reads the community
 * achievements pages of a fixed roster of large public "top owner" profiles (the same accounts
 * Goldberg's config tooling leans on): a hidden achievement's description shows on the page of
 * anyone who has unlocked it, and a completionist owner covers a whole game in one fetch.
 *
 * Strictly best-effort and non-fatal, matching the STEAM path: only runs when an earned hidden coin
 * still lacks a description, stops as soon as every needed description is found, caps the profiles
 * it tries, and treats every page as untrusted display HTML (see [SteamCommunityAchievementsParser]).
 * Any failure — a private profile, a markup change, a network error — leaves the coins untouched,
 * so the UI's redacted-description fallback stays in place. Cancellation always propagates.
