 * The single place a game's provider is mapped to its remote source. Keeping the RA-vs-Steam
 * decision here — and nowhere else — is what keeps the two providers cleanly separated: each
 * strategy is self-contained in its own island, and they meet only through this one exhaustive
 * `when` (which fails to compile if a provider is ever added without a source).
