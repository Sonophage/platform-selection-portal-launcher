/**
 * Fills in a missing steam_settings kit for an emu game folder: fetches the achievement schema
 * from the Steam Web API (the same read-only call [LocalSteamSource] uses for display) and writes
 * the files a current gbe_fork build needs — `achievements.json`, `stats.json` when the schema
 * carries stats, and a `configs.user.ini` whose save redirect keeps progress inside the game
 * folder where discovery can read it, plus the empty `saves/` folder the redirect points at so
 * the game is trackable before its first run. It also swaps the real Steam DLL beside the folder
 * for the bundled gbe_fork emu (backing the original up to `steam_api64_o.dll`), since the config
 * is inert while Valve's own DLL is loaded. Everything is only created/replaced when needed; icons
 * are never downloaded (the emu tracks unlocks without them).
 *
 * Generation is offered per game during a scan — the UI gates each write behind the user's choice.
