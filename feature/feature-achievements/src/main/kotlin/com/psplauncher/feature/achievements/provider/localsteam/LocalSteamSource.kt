/**
 * The LOCAL_STEAM provider: earned state from the GSE emulator's progress file in the game
 * folder, names/descriptions/icons from the Steam schema, rarity from the keyless global
 * percentages, tiers through [SteamCoinMapper]'s rules unchanged. Display-only — PFP reads what
 * the game already wrote; nothing here touches the emulator or the network beyond the same
 * read-only Steam Web API the STEAM provider uses.
 *
 * Hidden-description enrichment can't use the STEAM path (which reads the user's OWN profile page,
 * absent for an unowned emu copy), so it goes through [LocalSteamHiddenDescriptions] instead —
 * reading a roster of public top-owner profiles. Best-effort and never fatal.
