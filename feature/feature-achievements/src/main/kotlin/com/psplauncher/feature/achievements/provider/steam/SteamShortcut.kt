/**
 * Extracts the Steam App ID a shortcut-backed game already carries, so it can be linked
 * deterministically instead of guessed by title. Two common shapes:
 *
 *  - GameNative (`app.gamenative`) launch intents embed the id as `i.app_id=<n>` alongside
 *    `S.game_source=STEAM` — the source flag is required so a non-Steam GameNative game's internal
 *    id isn't mistaken for a Steam appid.
 *  - Classic `steam://rungameid/<n>` / `steam://run/<n>` URIs.
 *
 * See docs/shiba-coins-achievements-plan.md.
