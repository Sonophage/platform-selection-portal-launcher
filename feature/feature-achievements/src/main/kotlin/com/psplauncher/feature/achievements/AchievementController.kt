/**

 * data. Provider choice (RetroAchievements vs Steam) is resolved beneath this seam, never by callers.
 *
 * ViewModels depend on this interface, not on the [AchievementRepository] implementation — it is the
 * Controller in the coin system's MVC layering. See docs/shiba-coins-achievements-plan.md.
