/**
 * Imports the Steam account's achievement history with the probe-filter-fetch pipeline
 * (docs/account-achievements-plan.md Phase 3): one GetOwnedGames call refreshes the owned cache,
 * then each candidate syncs through the shared account path. The schema-first fetch makes a
 * no-achievements game cost one call, remembered in the memo so it is never probed again.
 *
 * Candidates are owned games that are not memo'd and whose playtime differs from the bookmarked
 * synced playtime — which makes the first run walk everything, an interrupted run resume where
 * it stopped, and a routine re-run touch only games played since (the cheap incremental path).
 * Zero-earned sets are kept only when a library game links to them; account-only entries need
 * actual progress, matching the RA import.
