/**
 * Validated arcade romset database, ES-DE style: an allowlist of recognised romset names mapped to
 * the specific system they belong to (cps1/cps2/cps3/neogeo, else generic mame) plus their full
 * game name. Built from the FBAlpha gamelist, console cores and BIOS/device sets removed (see
 * assets/arcade/arcade_romsets.tsv).
 *
 * Purpose: a folder of arcade `.zip` files is full of ambiguity — BIOS/device sets, non-game
 * archives, and CPS/Neo Geo/other titles all mixed together with generic "arcade" extensions.
 * Instead of turning every `.zip` into a library entry, the scanner asks this catalog to
 * (a) recognise valid romsets, (b) route them to the correct system regardless of which folder they
 * sit in, and (c) title them properly.
 *
 * Strictness differs by system. CPS1/2/3 and Neo Geo are fully covered by FBNeo, so a `.zip` filed
 * under one of those platforms that isn't a known romset is treated as invalid/incomplete and
 * skipped. Generic MAME is NOT strict — MAME's library far exceeds FBNeo's, so an unrecognised zip
 * in a MAME folder is kept (named from its filename) rather than dropped.
