/**
 * Assigns multi-disc set identity to a batch of freshly scanned games (docs/plans/README.md (C1)
 * steps 1–3). Runs over the games of one scan pass, so a full first scan of a folder groups every
 * disc together; games with no disc tag and no linking playlist keep a NULL [Game.discSetKey] and
 * are untouched.
 *
 * Set membership:
 *  - a game whose raw filename carries a disc tag (see [parseDiscTag]) joins the set keyed by
 *    platform + containing folder + disc-stripped/region-stripped/revision-stripped title
 *  - an `.m3u` whose playlist entries resolve to scanned games becomes that set's primary row
 *    (disc number NULL — the emulator handles disc swapping from the playlist), and the listed
 *    discs join the same set as non-primary rows; entries without a disc tag take playlist order
 *  - every set gets exactly one primary: the `.m3u` when present, otherwise the lowest-numbered
 *    disc (ties broken by path for determinism)
 *
 * The containing folder is part of the key so two dumps of the same game in different folders do
 * not merge (over-merging is worse than under-merging — see the plan's Risks). The folder's
 * trailing segment is cleaned with the same rules as the title (see [cleanRomTitle]): a disc tag
 * is stripped ("one folder per disc": `<Game> (Disc 1)/`, `<Game> (Disc 2)/`) and region/revision
 * tags are removed, because those sibling folders are one set, not two dumps — and the region tag
 * on one disc's folder may be missing from its sibling's (`Parasite Eve II (USA) (Disc 1)/` next
 * to `Parasite Eve II (Disc 2)/`). Structurally different folders (NA/ vs EU/) survive the
 * cleaning and still keep dumps apart.
