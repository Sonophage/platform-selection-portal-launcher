 * [DiscImageResolver]; this one is SAF-friendly because sheet contents must be read over the
 * granted tree's document URIs, which only the caller knows how to open.
 *
 * Suppression is authoritative-content based: a sheet that can't be read suppresses nothing, and
 * only same-folder siblings are suppressed (a cue never hides a same-named file in another
 * folder). Under-suppressing is safe — the file just stays a row, as it does today.
