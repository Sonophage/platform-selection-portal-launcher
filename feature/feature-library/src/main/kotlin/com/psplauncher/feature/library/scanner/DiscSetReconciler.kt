/**
 * Re-derives multi-disc set identity (and detected region) over a platform's already-scanned rows
 * plus the rows a scan just added, and upserts only the rows whose disc fields or region changed.
 * The single owner of that reconcile-and-persist policy so [LibraryScanner] (Scan All / resume /
 * mount / unplug) and the XMB manual Memory Card scan can't drift on how incremental disc-set
 * joins are applied.
 *
 * The scanner only enriches newly added rows against themselves, so a disc arriving into an
 * already-scanned `.m3u` set (or a new `.m3u` adopting existing discs) needs the union re-derived.
 * The derivation is deterministic and idempotent — a fully correct row comes back unchanged and is
 * skipped, so this is safe to run on every scan that added something. A per-row upsert failure
 * here is non-fatal: the survey itself completed, and the next scan that adds a game re-derives
 * the same union.
