 * [LibraryScanner] and the settings auto-detect autoload can't drift on how it's computed.
 *
 * A failed read throws rather than returning an empty set — an incomplete existing-path set is
 * unsafe for upserts and Missing reconciliation (a half-read set could duplicate or mass-flag
 * rows), so callers must decide how to fail their own operation.
