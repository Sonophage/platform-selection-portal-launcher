# PSPLauncher — Architecture

PSPLauncher (PFP) is an Android **home-screen launcher** styled after the PSP/PS3
**XMB** (Cross Media Bar). It presents installed apps, emulator ROM libraries, and user
collections as a horizontal bar of categories with a vertical list of items beneath the
selected category, and launches games through external emulator apps.

- **Package:** `com.psplauncher.launcher` (debug builds use the `.debug` suffix)
- **Min / Target / Compile SDK:** 29 (Android 10 — Winlator's floor) / 35 / 37
- **Version:** declared in [`app/build.gradle.kts`](app/build.gradle.kts) (`versionName` / `versionCode`) — read it there, not here.
- **Stack:** Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, MVVM + Clean Architecture, Hilt DI, Room, DataStore,
  Coil (image loading), Media3/ExoPlayer, Coroutines/Flow.
- **Entry points:** [`PFPApplication`](app/src/main/kotlin/com/psplauncher/launcher/PFPApplication.kt)
  (Hilt + first-run DB seeding) and
  [`MainActivity`](app/src/main/kotlin/com/psplauncher/launcher/MainActivity.kt)
  (declared as the `HOME` launcher).

## Design principles

| Principle | What it means in practice |
|---|---|
| **Launcher-first** | Replaces the Android home screen. Users should never need to leave PFP to play games. |
| **Performance over polish** | The XMB wave is iconic but must never kill frame rate. Tiered degradation over dropped frames. |
| **No background polling** | Nothing watches the filesystem. No `FileObserver`, no polling loop, no scanning service. Rescans are event-driven — see [ADR-0002](docs/adr/0002-rescan-triggers-without-a-filesystem-watcher.md). |
| **Zero junk in release** | Debug tooling is compile-time excluded. The release APK contains no simulation code. |
| **PSP soul, Android body** | The aesthetic is XMB but the interaction model is Android — back gestures, Intents, Compose. |
| **Tested by default** | Every new module ships with unit tests. Pure-JVM tests (MockK + Turbine) for logic; integration tests for the database and migrations. |
| **A rejected import changes nothing** | Media and icon imports are staged. A file that fails validation never disturbs the assignment that already worked. |

## Module structure

The project is multi-module with a strict dependency direction: **features depend on core,
core does not depend on features**, and `app` wires everything together via Hilt.

```
app  ──▶ feature:*  ──▶ core:core-ui ──▶ core:core-data ──▶ core:core-domain ──▶ core:core-common
```

| Module | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `app` | DI wiring, manifest, `PFPApplication`, `MainActivity` (HOME launcher), broadcast receivers |
| `studio` | Theme Studio — Compose Multiplatform Desktop companion (Windows/Linux/macOS); must never grow an Android dependency |
| `core:theme-kit` | Pure-JVM theme core shared with the Theme Studio: PTF/BMP/GIM/LZR parsers, `.pfptheme` codec, color cascade, icon-slot registry, XMB layout spec, and the shared limit objects (`UiMediaLimits`, `MotionLimits`, `IconGifSupport`) |
| `core:core-archive` | Pure-JVM bounded ZIP ingestion (`BoundedZipReader`, `SafeArchivePath`) shared by theme parsing, backup restore, and the theme codec |
| `core:core-common` | Cross-cutting utilities and extensions (incl. the shared Keystore AES-GCM helper) |
| `core:core-domain` | Domain models, repository interfaces, use-case-level contracts (no Android deps where avoidable) |
| `core:core-data` | Room database, DAOs, entities, migrations, DataStore, repository implementations, seeders, and the user-asset stores (`CustomIconStore`, `UiMediaStore`, `PfpThemeStore`) |
| `core:core-navigation` | Pure navigation logic with no Android dependency — `NavigationEngine`, `NavigationCommand`, grid movement (`gridMove`). Consumed by feature-xmb and feature-settings so cursor behavior is unit-testable away from Compose |
| `core:core-ui` | Shared Compose components, theming, the category-icon catalog, wave renderer, motion-wallpaper surfaces, `MenuSoundPlayer` |
| `feature:feature-xmb` | The XMB shell — wave background, category bar, item list, status bar, game/app detail, context menus, the custom-icon editor overlay, the main `XMBViewModel` |
| `feature:feature-library` | ROM scanning into the Memory Card library, plus the rescan triggers |
| `feature:feature-launcher` | Emulator detection, the launch-resolution ladder, and the launch dispatcher |
| `feature:feature-artwork` | Metadata/artwork scrapers (ScreenScraper/TGDB/IGDB/SteamGridDB), the `ArtworkStore` storage seam, the portable artwork library (`portable/` — user-owned SAF folder, manifest, per-entry metadata) and the ES-DE artwork importer (`importer/`) |
| `feature:feature-themes` | Theme loader/repository, built-in themes, `.pfptheme` / PSP `.ptf` install paths |
| `feature:feature-settings` | All settings screens, the first-run setup wizard, PC game import |
| `feature:feature-appbar` | App drawer, app→category classification, filtering |
| `feature:feature-backup` | Backup & restore (`.pfpbackup`) |
| `baselineprofile` | Records the startup baseline profile with the Macrobenchmark runner. Run deliberately (`./gradlew :app:generateReleaseBaselineProfile`), never as part of an ordinary build |

## Data layer (`core:core-data`)

- **Room** database [`PFPDatabase`](core/core-data/src/main/kotlin/com/psplauncher/core/data/database/PFPDatabase.kt)
  — the `version` in its `@Database` annotation is the current schema version. Migrations are
  hand-written, one `MIGRATION_n_n+1` per version, registered
  in [`DatabaseModule`](core/core-data/src/main/kotlin/com/psplauncher/core/data/database/di/DatabaseModule.kt).
  **Never** use destructive migration — it would wipe the user's library.
- **Seeding** is first-run only, gated by a DataStore flag, in
  [`DatabaseInitializer`](core/core-data/src/main/kotlin/com/psplauncher/core/data/database/seeder/DatabaseInitializer.kt).
  Definition changes that must reach already-seeded installs ship as migrations (e.g. the v13
  Xbox 360 platform) or as idempotent per-launch reconciles (built-in categories).
- **Key entities:** `GameEntity` (games *and* app-shortcut rows, distinguished by `content_type`
  — `GAME` vs `ANDROID_APP`), `PlatformEntity`, `CategoryEntity`, `MemoryCardEntity`,
  `CollectionEntity`, `ThemeEntity`, and the `launch_outcomes` table added in v41.
- **DataStore** holds settings/preferences (icon style, wave style, color scheme, setup flags,
  custom wallpaper, media stamps, seed flags).
- **User assets are files, not blobs.** Custom icons, UI media and extracted theme icons live under
  `filesDir/` with the directory as the source of truth; DataStore holds only invalidation stamps.

## Library scanning (`feature:feature-library`)

[`LibraryScanner`](feature/feature-library/src/main/kotlin/com/psplauncher/feature/library/scanner/LibraryScanner.kt)
is the single owner of ROM-survey policy: source resolution, one-upsert-per-path across multiple
sources, optional Missing reconciliation, changed-only persistence, per-card single-flight, and IO
execution. Both the settings interface and the trigger path delegate to it — see
[ADR-0001](docs/adr/0001-library-scanner-owns-rom-survey.md).

Scans start one of two ways:

- **Manually**, from the Library Manager or the XMB's Memory Card scan action.
- **By trigger**, through `LibraryRescanCoordinator` → `RescanTriggerBus`: app resume (throttled to
  one scan per 5 minutes), plus media mount and USB disconnect (2 s debounce, where a later event
  cancels the pending job). All triggers share a single-flight mutex, and console discovery runs
  before the incremental pass so a ROM dropped into a folder for a console with no Memory Card yet
  is still picked up.

Nothing watches the filesystem. Every scan traces back to a user action, a lifecycle event, or a
system broadcast — the guards and the rejected alternatives are recorded in
[ADR-0002](docs/adr/0002-rescan-triggers-without-a-filesystem-watcher.md).

## Game / emulator launching (`feature:feature-launcher`)

**Detection.** [`KnownEmulatorCatalog`](feature/feature-launcher/src/main/kotlin/com/psplauncher/feature/launcher/KnownEmulatorCatalog.kt)
lists supported emulators (package, launch activity, intent shape, supported platforms);
[`EmulatorDetector`](feature/feature-launcher/src/main/kotlin/com/psplauncher/feature/launcher/EmulatorDetector.kt)
scans installed packages (plus RetroArch cores) into `EmulatorProfile`s on startup.

**Resolution.** [`EmulatorLaunchResolver`](feature/feature-launcher/src/main/kotlin/com/psplauncher/feature/launcher/EmulatorLaunchResolver.kt)
walks the configuration ladder and returns a typed `ResolvedLaunch(profile, source, core)` — the
winning profile *and* the `LaunchSource` enum naming which level decided it, so the UI can attribute
the choice on screen without matching on strings. Precedence, pinned by tests:

1. per-game override → 2. Memory Card emulator → 3. platform default → 4. first valid candidate

The resolver is pure: every input is passed in, so it carries no Android, database or Hilt
dependency. [`EmulatorIntentResolver`](feature/feature-launcher/src/main/kotlin/com/psplauncher/feature/launcher/EmulatorIntentResolver.kt)
then builds the `Intent` (`ACTION_VIEW` with a FileProvider content URI, or a `COMPONENT` intent
with extras), with fallbacks for emulators whose intent filters omit a MIME type.

**Dispatch.** Every game-path launch funnels through
[`LaunchDispatcher`](feature/feature-launcher/src/main/kotlin/com/psplauncher/feature/launcher/LaunchDispatcher.kt),
which owns three things that used to be scattered across call sites:

- **Named failures.** `startActivity` lives here, so an `ActivityNotFoundException` or
  `SecurityException` can never be silently swallowed. Preflight also refuses launches with revoked
  SAF grants, or launch activities dropped by an emulator update.
- **Outcome recording.** Each settled launch writes a `LaunchOutcome` row (schema v41).
- **Post-launch verification.** PFP is the HOME launcher, so no usage-stats permission is needed: a
  successful dispatch backgrounds it. If the host is never stopped inside the stop window, the
  emulator never took the foreground; a return before the minimum session length is treated as an
  instant crash or refusal. Both are conservative — a real session records `SUCCEEDED` silently and
  never pops UI.

Failures emit a `LaunchRecoveryRequest` so the shell can offer retry, a different emulator or core,
per-system defaults, and copyable diagnostics instead of a dead end.

## State & the XMB shell (`feature:feature-xmb`)

- [`XMBViewModel`](feature/feature-xmb/src/main/kotlin/com/psplauncher/feature/xmb/viewmodel/XMBViewModel.kt)
  exposes a single `XMBUiState` `StateFlow`. The stateless
  [`XMBShell`](feature/feature-xmb/src/main/kotlin/com/psplauncher/feature/xmb/ui/XMBShell.kt)
  renders it; `XMBShellContainer` wires the ViewModel's callbacks in.
- **Navigation model:** the Games category root lists synthetic folders — **All Games**,
  **Favorites** (shown only when something is favorited), user collections, then one row per
  enabled Memory Card. Folders are entered by setting `selectedPlatformId` (sentinels
  `__all_games__` / `__favorites__`) or `selectedCollectionId`; BACK clears them.
- **Settings hierarchy:** two levels. L1 sections (Library, Media, Emulators, Interface, System)
  open as nested XMB items; L2 entries route to settings screens through the
  `SETTINGS_SCREEN_ROUTES` allowlist in `SettingsNavHost`. The structure is pinned by
  `SettingsHierarchyTest`.
- **Input:** a gamepad dispatcher routes D-pad/A/B/Y to the focused layer. `hasBlockingOverlay`
  guards the main XMB navigation so input never drives the bar behind a dialog or overlay. Cursor
  movement itself lives in `core:core-navigation`, away from Compose.
- **Item icons** ([`XMBItemList`](feature/feature-xmb/src/main/kotlin/com/psplauncher/feature/xmb/ui/XMBItemList.kt)):
  games show a 144:80 landscape tile; apps with artwork show the same tile, apps without it show
  the launcher icon; folder rows use console / `sysicon_*` art.

## Icon system (`core:core-ui`)

All built-in category-pick icons live in one catalog,
[`CategoryIcons`](core/core-ui/src/main/kotlin/com/psplauncher/core/ui/icons/CategoryIcons.kt):
each `iconKey` maps to an individual drawable (`catbar_*` column glyphs + `sysicon_*` console art,
all from the [xmb-menu-es-de](https://github.com/anthonycaccese/xmb-menu-es-de) theme).
`categoryIconFor()` resolves current and legacy keys; `CategoryIconGlyph` renders them. There is
**no sprite sheet and no hand-drawn (Canvas) icon code** — that was removed pre-launch.

The catalog is the *built-in* tier. What actually draws for a given icon slot is decided by the
render tiers: **user pick > theme icon > built-in**.

## Customization: icons, UI media, and motion

Four subsystems share one shape: a per-slot file store
under `filesDir/`, a limits object in `core:theme-kit` so the app and the desktop Studio agree on
the numbers, staged imports, and a DataStore stamp for cache invalidation.

**Custom icons.** [`CustomIconStore`](core/core-data/src/main/kotlin/com/psplauncher/core/data/repository/CustomIconStore.kt)
keeps one file per slot at `filesDir/custom-icons/<slotKey>.<png|jpg|webp|gif>`. Keys come from
`CustomizableIcons` (theme slots plus `sysicon_*` console slots) and are used verbatim as
filenames, which makes key validation load-bearing — it is what stops a crafted key escaping the
directory. Limits live in `CustomIconLimits` (8 MB, 512 px, 120 frames, 10 s for GIFs). Stills are
decoded in the store; animated GIFs are read by Coil at render time, so an import must evict the
replaced path from the image cache through the `CustomIconCacheEvictor` seam or the old animation
keeps playing. Editing happens in a live fullscreen overlay above the XMB, and only the focused
row/column animates (gated on battery saver and `hasBlockingOverlay`).

**UI media.** `UiMediaStore` keeps `filesDir/ui-media/<slot>.<ext>` for nine slots: six menu
sounds, the boot video/audio pair, and GameBoot's one replaceable clip (`UiMediaSlot`). Per-slot
duration and byte caps come from `UiMediaLimits`, and a duration bound is always mandatory.
`MenuSoundPlayer` resolves a custom sample over its bundled `R.raw` default *inside the player*, so
roughly ninety call sites needed no change; `BOOT_AUDIO` resolves through `bundledDefaultRes` /
`resolveBootAudio`. GameBoot is deliberately ONE thing: one on/off switch, one built-in
Compose-drawn sequence with its own bundled sound (`gameBootDefaultAudioUri`, `sfx_launch`), and one
slot the user can replace it with — a clip that brings its own audio, which is why
`resolveGameBootAudio` has two branches and no GameBoot audio slot exists. The switch fully owns the
transition: on plays the presentation with its sound, off plays nothing, and a game boot is never
scored by the menu's App Launch sound (the same `sfx_launch` sample) in either state — confirm
sites suppress it for games unconditionally, so GameBoot off is a silent launch.
`pruneOrphans()` sweeps files and preferences for retired slots on cold start and after a backup
restore (including the retired `gameboot_audio`).

**Motion wallpapers.** `MotionWallpaperBackground` composites a looping clip over an import-time
poster still. Video decodes through ExoPlayer; **GIF and animated WebP never construct a player at
all** — they render through a separate `AnimatedImageSurface` backed by Coil's animated decoder,
because ExoPlayer has no GIF extractor. Every freeze condition releases the decoder outright and
falls back to the poster rather than holding a paused player. `MotionLimits` (1080p, 60 s, 60 MB)
is shared with the Studio.

**Theme bundles.** The `.pfptheme` schema **v3** adds animated GIF icons, `sysicons/`, and a
`motion.<ext>` entry over v2. It is additive: readers never gate on `schemaVersion`, so a v3 bundle
still opens on a v2-era build and simply sees the v2 subset. `PfpThemeStore.saveCurrentLook()`
flattens the *applied look* — user picks having already won over theme icons — into a new bundle,
deliberately excluding the device-specific XMB layout adjustment. Applying a theme never clears
`custom-icons/`; it replaces only the middle render tier.

## Conventions

- **MVVM:** ViewModels own state (`StateFlow<UiState>`); composables are stateless and driven by
  state + callbacks.
- **Repositories** are the boundary between features and the data layer; features never touch DAOs
  directly.
- **Pure logic leaves Android.** Navigation math, launch-ladder precedence, scan policy and the
  theme/limits objects are plain Kotlin, so their tests need no device.
- **Seams over platform mocks.** Wall clocks (`RescanClock`, `LaunchClock`), cache eviction
  (`CustomIconCacheEvictor`) and scan sources (`ScanSourceResolver`) are injected interfaces, so
  timing and IO boundaries are drivable from unit tests.
- **Long-running work** (scans, artwork fetches, backups) runs off the main thread and surfaces
  progress through `BackgroundTaskNotifier` (system notifications).

## Where decisions are recorded

- **`docs/adr/`** — architecture decision records. Read these before proposing a change that
  reverses one.
- **`CONTEXT.md`** — the domain glossary. Terms defined there (Memory Card, ROM survey, icon slot,
  render tier, applied look, UI media slot) are used precisely in this document.
- **`docs/plans/README.md`** — the plan index: what shipped, what did not, and why. Implemented
  plans are deleted, so the index is the record.
- **`CHANGELOG.md`** — user-facing history, with unreleased work kept separate.

## Build & run

There is one build — no product flavors. See the README's
[For Developers](README.md#for-developers) section for the full build guide.

```bash
# Build the debug APK
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug

# Install to a connected device
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

If `adb install` reports `INSTALL_FAILED_UPDATE_INCOMPATIBLE` (debug-signature mismatch),
uninstall first — note this clears local app data:

```bash
adb uninstall com.psplauncher.launcher.debug
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```
