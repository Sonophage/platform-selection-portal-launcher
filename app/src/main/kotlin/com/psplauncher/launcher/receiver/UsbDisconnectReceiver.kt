/**
 * Rescan trigger for the "copied ROMs over the USB cable, then unplugged" case.
 *
 * [MediaMountReceiver] does NOT cover this: a PC transfer goes over MTP, and MTP never unmounts the
 * storage volume — Android keeps it mounted and lets the PC read/write through MediaProvider. So
 * unplugging fires no ACTION_MEDIA_MOUNTED (nothing was ever unmounted to re-mount). ACTION_MEDIA_
 * MOUNTED only fires for physically inserted removable media (an SD card, USB-OTG storage).
 *
 * ACTION_USB_STATE is the signal that actually marks the unplug moment: its `connected` extra flips
 * to false when the cable is pulled. Firing the strong rescan on that connected -> disconnected edge
 * catches the freshly-copied ROMs right when the user is back on the device.
 *
 * Routed to [LibraryRescanCoordinator.onMediaMounted] — the same strong-signal path the mount
 * receiver uses (throttle-bypassing, debounced, single-flight), so a mount and an unplug arriving
 * together collapse into one scan rather than two.
 *
 * ACTION_USB_STATE and its `connected` extra are @hide in the public SDK, so the stable platform
 * string values are used directly; they are a fixed contract the USB stack has emitted for years.
