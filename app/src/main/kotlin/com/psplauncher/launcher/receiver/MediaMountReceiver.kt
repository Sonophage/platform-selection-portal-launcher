/**
 * Strong rescan signal for PHYSICALLY INSERTED removable media — an SD card or USB-OTG drive
 * mounting. That is the moment ROMs on freshly inserted media appear, so unlike the onResume path
 * this bypasses the time throttle (see docs/missing-roms-plan.md).
 *
 * This does NOT cover copying ROMs over a USB cable from a PC: MTP never unmounts the volume, so
 * unplugging fires no ACTION_MEDIA_MOUNTED. That case is handled by [UsbDisconnectReceiver].
 *
 * Only ACTION_MEDIA_MOUNTED is handled. Unmount and friends are deliberately ignored — an
 * unmounted card is exactly the untrustworthy state the removal guard exists for, and diffing the
 * library against it would flag the whole card as missing.
 *
 * Registered at runtime by MainActivity (like [InstallShortcutReceiver]) rather than in the
 * manifest, both because Android 8+ blocks manifest registration for this implicit broadcast and
 * because rescanning is only useful while PFP is actually up.
