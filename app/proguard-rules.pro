# lifecycle-compose 2.8.x resolves its LocalLifecycleOwner by REFLECTING into
# compose-ui's AndroidCompositionLocals_androidKt.getLocalLifecycleOwner() (backward
# compatibility with compose-ui 1.6). The library's own consumer rule has a typo
# (matches a ProvidableCompositionLocal[] array return type), so it never fires, R8
# renames the method, the reflection fails, and ANY read of the lifecycle-compose
# local crashes release builds with "CompositionLocal LocalLifecycleOwner not
# present" (debug is unaffected — nothing is renamed there). Keep the real signature
# so the bridge works.

# RetroAchievements api-kotlin deserializes its response POJOs with GSON REFLECTION, and the
# JitPack build ships no consumer rules. Without these keeps, R8 renames/strips the model
# fields and constructors, Gson throws JsonIOException on every RA response, and release
# builds report "Couldn't load the RetroAchievements game list" (debug builds are unaffected
# because nothing is renamed). The NetworkResponseAdapter reflects over generic response
# types, so it needs its classes and the Signature attribute intact too.

# api.core holds Gson plumbing the POJOs reference REFLECTIVELY: BooleanJsonDeserializer is
# named in @JsonAdapter field annotations and instantiated by Gson's ConstructorConstructor.
# R8 full mode sees no direct construction, strips its constructor and marks it abstract, and
# adapter creation for any type using it (e.g. GetGameInfoAndUserProgress.Response.isFinal)
# throws "Abstract class can't be instantiated" -> Retrofit's "Unable to create converter".
# GetGameList's types don't use it, which is why matching worked while every sync failed.
# Root-caused via a desktop R8 repro (same rules, same jars) and its retrace mapping.
