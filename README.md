# PSPLauncher

**A controller-first Android game launcher inspired by the PSP's XMB (Cross Media Bar).**

A horizontal category bar crosses a vertical item list — the **crossbar** — and replaces your
Android home screen as a single front end for ROM emulation, Android games, PC-layer titles
(Winlator), native apps, and your music, video and photo libraries.

## 1. What is PSPLauncher?

PSPLauncher is a **home-screen replacement** for Android handhelds, tablets and phones that
gives your whole library the look and feel of a PlayStation Portable. It is a unified game
frontend: ROM emulation, Android games, PC-layer titles and native apps brought together under one
cohesive interface that feels like the golden era of handheld gaming. Everything is one crossbar
away and fully controller-navigable:

- **Games** — ROMs launched through the emulators you already have installed, Android games, and
  PC-layer titles (Winlator and friends), unified under one **Game** category.
- **Media** — Music, Video and Photo sections that scan folders you choose.
- **Apps** — your installed apps, organized into categories you design.
- **Personalization** — a deep theme system (custom wallpapers, one-color palettes, imported PSP
  themes), replaceable icons, sounds and boot videos, plus a desktop **Theme Studio** for authoring.

It is **local-first**: no account, no telemetry, and the network is only touched when *you* ask it
to fetch artwork. See [Permissions & privacy](#5-permissions--privacy).

---

## 2. Getting started

### 2.1 Requirements

| | |
|---|---|
| **Android version** | 10 (API 29) or newer |
| **Form factor** | Phones, handhelds, tablets, and foldables (the layout adapts to each) |
| **Input** | A game controller is recommended; full touch navigation is also supported |
| **Emulators** | Installed separately — PFP launches them, it does not emulate anything itself |

### 2.2 Install the APK

PFP is distributed as a **side-loaded APK** (it is not on the Google Play Store).

1. Download the APK (`PSPLauncher-<version>.apk`).
2. Open the file on your device. Android will ask you to allow installs from your browser or file
   manager the first time — approve it.
3. Tap **Install**.

> Building the APK yourself instead? See [For Developers](#for-developers).

### 2.3 Set PFP as your home screen (Optional)

PFP registers as an Android **HOME** launcher.

1. Press the **Home** button.
2. When Android asks which launcher to use, pick **PSPLauncher** and choose **Always**.

You can change this later under *Android Settings ▸ Apps ▸ Default apps ▸ Home app*.

> A few features (importing game shortcuts from other launchers, capturing pinned shortcuts)
> require PFP to be the **active default launcher**.

### 2.4 Grant permissions

PFP asks for permissions **only when a feature needs them**:

- **Notifications** (Android 13+) — lets background scans and artwork fetches report progress, and
  lets other apps ask you to confirm a game shortcut before it is added.
- **Usage access** (optional) — powers the "Recently Used" filter in the App Drawer.

Full detail in [Permissions & privacy](#5-permissions--privacy).

### 2.5 First-run setup

On a fresh install PFP opens a guided **setup wizard**:

1. **Welcome** — what the wizard will set up.
2. **ROM Roots** — grant one or more root folders; consoles live in subfolders under them.
3. **Music / Video / Photo** — one optional root per media section (multi-root supported).
4. **Artwork** — the artwork library folder, with an embedded import offer.
5. **Online Services** — connect SteamGridDB and IGDB, plus the ScreenScraper *user*
   account (each optional; IGDB and ScreenScraper credentials are tested live).
6. **Achievement Services** — RetroAchievements and Steam accounts.
7. **Vita Data Folder** & **RetroArch** — offered only when those apps are installed.
8. **Finish.**

Every step can be skipped and everything it configures is the same setting you can reach
later in Settings — the wizard is just a shortcut. You can re-run it any time from
**Settings ▸ Re-Run Setup Wizard**. Upgrading installs that are already configured never
see it.

> ScreenScraper additionally requires a **developer ID/password** pair. PFP ships with an
> obfuscated built-in pair, so scraping works out of the box — nothing to enter or configure.

With a ROM root set, the fastest way to load your library is
**Settings ▸ Library ▸ Library Manager ▸ Auto-Detect from ROM Root** — it walks the
root's ES-DE system folders and creates a Memory Card for every console that contains
games (including a **Windows Memory Card** for PC games). Full detail in
[Setting up a console](#42-setting-up-a-console-memory-card).

---

## 3. Navigation & controls

PFP is built for a controller but works fully with touch.

| Action | Controller | Touch |
|---|---|---|
| Move between items | D-Pad / Left Stick | Tap an item |
| Switch category (left / right) | D-Pad ◀ ▶ | Tap the category |
| Select / launch / open | **A / ✕** | Tap |
| Back / close / exit a folder | **B / ◯**, or D-Pad ◀ (see below) | On-screen Back / left-edge swipe / swipe left |
| Options (context) menu | **Y / △** (or long-press) | Long-press |
| Switch App-Drawer tabs | **L1 / R1** | Tap a tab |
| Confirm in pickers | **Start** | Confirm button |

**D-Pad ◀ backs you out.** Inside a folder, a flyout or a settings screen, LEFT leaves one level —
but only where LEFT is not already doing something (stepping into a row's inline buttons, or
adjusting a slider), so nothing it used to do is taken away. Turn it off in
*Settings ▸ Controller ▸ Left Backs Out*. The touch equivalent — a leftward swipe inside a folder or
flyout — is always on, like the left-edge pull. On a Settings screen or a wizard page, a drag
anywhere scrolls the page, including on the header and the footer.

The **horizontal bar** is your categories — by default **Settings, Photo, Music, Video, Game,
Network, App Store**, plus any custom ones. The **vertical list** under the selected category is its
items. While any menu, settings screen, picker or dialog is open, the crossbar is locked — input
only drives the overlay on top. Every binding is remappable in *Settings ▸ Controller*.

---

## 4. Feature guide

### 4.1 The Game library

Selecting **Game** shows, in order:

1. **All Games** — every real game across all consoles, aggregated. Only actual games appear here;
   Android / Video / Music apps never show up automatically.
2. **Favorites** — appears directly under All Games **only when you have favorited at least one
   game**, and hides again when you have none.
3. **Your Collections** — user-made folders (see [4.4](#44-favorites--collections)).
4. **Memory Cards** — one row per console you have configured.

Open All Games, Favorites, a collection, or a console to drill in; press **B / ◯** to go back. On
wide and foldable screens the crossbar slides to the left edge while drilled in, giving the game
list and its artwork the center-right of the screen.

### 4.2 Setting up a console (Memory Card)

Consoles are added as **Memory Cards** and managed entirely through your **ROM Root** —
one folder grant covers every console; there is no per-console folder picking. PFP never
auto-scans your whole device.

**The fast path — Auto-Detect.** *Library Manager ▸ Auto-Detect from ROM Root* walks the
root's ES-DE system folders (`gba`, `snes`, `psx`, …), creates a Memory Card for every
folder that actually contains games, and loads them in one scan. It also sets up the
**Windows Memory Card** (wiring `<root>/windows` and its `import/` drop folder, and
importing any exported PC games).

**Adding one console by hand:**

1. **Settings ▸ Library ▸ Library Manager ▸ Add Console** (requires a ROM Root).
2. **Choose Platform** (NES, SNES, PSP, PS2, Dreamcast, Xbox 360, …). The console's
   folder is derived from the root automatically — an existing recognized subfolder if
   one is there, otherwise the standard ES-DE folder name.
3. **Assign Emulator** — this becomes the console's default. (Windows skips this step;
   PC games go through your installed PC launchers instead.)
4. **Scan Now**, or create the card and scan later.

Manage a card any time from *Library Manager*: rename it, change its emulator, hide/show
it, **Scan This Console**, or remove it (ROM files on disk are never deleted). Each root's
row lists the consoles homed under it. Library-wide passes live here too: **Scan All
Consoles** (add-only) and **Re-Scan All (Remove Missing)**, which additionally removes
entries whose ROM file has vanished — behind a confirm step, and skipped for any console
whose folder cannot be read, so an unmounted SD card never wipes a library.

> **Scanning is always manual** — there is no background watcher. Re-scan after adding ROMs.
> ROMs on removable SD cards / USB volumes are supported.

### 4.3 Emulators

PFP launches games through **external emulator apps** — install the emulators you want and PFP
detects them automatically on startup from a curated catalog, plus one profile per installed
**RetroArch** core. A selection of what is recognized out of the box:

| System | Emulators |
|---|---|
| PSP | PPSSPP / PPSSPP Gold |
| PS1 | DuckStation |
| PS2 | NetherSX2 / AetherSX2 |
| GameCube / Wii | Dolphin |
| Nintendo DS / 3DS | melonDS, DraStic / Azahar, Citra, Lime3DS |
| Switch | Sudachi / Yuzu / Suyu family |
| N64 | Mupen64Plus FZ / AE |
| GB / GBC / GBA | mGBA, My Boy!, GBA.emu, GBC.emu |
| NES / SNES / Genesis / PC Engine / Neo Geo / WonderSwan / Lynx | the `*.emu` family |
| Dreamcast | Flycast, Redream |
| Xbox 360 | X360 Mobile (`.iso`) |
| Anything with libretro cores | RetroArch (one profile per installed core) |

**Which emulator launches a game?** PFP resolves it in priority order:
**per-game override → Memory Card emulator → the platform default → first available.** Set a
per-game emulator from a game's **△** options; set a console default in *Library Manager*.

You never have to guess which of those won. A game's detail screen shows the emulator, the core,
and *where the choice came from* — with a tap to change it right there.

**Per-System Defaults** (*Settings ▸ Emulators ▸ Per-System Defaults*) is the overview: every
console with its default emulator and core, how many games it covers, and badges for the two states
that break launches — **NO EMULATOR** (nothing installed can run this system) and **CORE MISSING**
(the emulator is there, but the RetroArch core it needs is not). You can also clear per-game
overrides in bulk for one console from here.

**When a launch fails**, PFP tells you instead of dropping you back at the crossbar. It checks
before launching that the emulator still exists and that PFP still has permission to read the ROM —
both of which an OS or emulator update can quietly revoke — and it verifies afterwards that the
emulator actually came to the foreground. If something goes wrong you get a recovery sheet: retry,
switch emulator or core, jump to Per-System Defaults, or copy a diagnostic you can paste into a bug
report.

**Custom Emulator Wizard** — for anything not in the catalog, *Settings ▸ Emulators ▸ Add Custom
Emulator* walks you through it: pick an installed app, let PFP auto-detect its launch settings,
edit any field, **Test Launch** with a real ROM, then **Save**. The result is usable as a platform,
Memory Card, or per-game emulator.

### 4.4 Favorites & Collections

- **Favorites** — mark any game from its **△** options (*Add to Favorites*). A **Favorites** folder
  appears under All Games and hides automatically when empty.
- **Collections** — custom folders (e.g. "RPGs", "Currently Playing"). A game can live in several at
  once. Create one from *Settings ▸ Collections* or a game's **△ ▸ Add to Collection**; toggle
  membership with a ✓. Manage (rename, reorder, delete) from *Settings ▸ Collections*.

### 4.5 Game & app options (△)

Press **Y / △** (or long-press) on any item for its context menu.

- **Games** — Launch Game, Edit Title, Edit Note. Everything else (favorites,
  collections, artwork, emulator choice, icon display, file location) lives on the
  **Game Detail** screen and its Options menu.
- **Memory Cards** — Scan This Console, **Update Metadata** (text-only pass, artwork
  untouched), **Scrape Missing Artwork** (fills only games missing primary art), pin,
  hide, rename. The Windows card adds **Import PC Games**.
- **All Games** — sorting plus **Manage Library**, which opens the Library settings.
- **Android apps** — Launch, Edit App Details, Add to Favorites/Collection,
  Move/Pin/Hide/Rename.

The full **Game Detail** and **App Detail** screens also show hero art, metadata,
screenshots, publisher, and total play time.

### 4.6 Artwork & the Artwork Studio

Box art, hero banners, logos, screenshots and icons are fetched **on request**. Add a free
**SteamGridDB** key (and optionally ScreenScraper / TheGamesDB / IGDB) in *Settings ▸ Artwork*.

- **Quick scrape** — *Settings ▸ Artwork* offers scrape-all, scrape-missing-only, and cache
  clearing. "Scrape Missing" fills only the gaps and never overwrites existing art.
- **Artwork Studio** — from a game's **Artwork** button, a full-screen, controller-first editor with
  a tab per artwork kind (ICON0, ICON1, Box Art, 3D Box, Physical Media, Hero, Background, Logo,
  Screenshot, Manual, Video). Each tab can pull from **ScreenScraper, SteamGridDB** (with an NSFW
  filter), **TheGamesDB, IGDB,** and **Local File**. Preview a candidate before applying (videos
  play a muted loop, manuals page through), then commit. Press **Start** for per-slot actions:
  Adjust Crop, Restore Previous, Reset to Scraped Default, Clear, and File Info.
- **Crop / position editor** — an aspect-locked frame per kind with the image panning and scaling
  behind it. Crops bake into the displayed file while the untouched original is kept for lossless
  re-crops.

**Portable artwork library** — in *Settings ▸ Artwork ▸ Artwork Folder & Import* you can point PFP
at a folder it keeps in an **ES-DE-compatible** layout, so your art is user-owned and readable by
other frontends with no export step. The same screen imports ES-DE `downloaded_media` (and
`gamelist.xml` metadata), relinks moved files, and exports for ES-DE.

#### Folder layout

The library is a clean two-folder root. Everything under `Artwork/` is a standard ES-DE
`downloaded_media` tree, so you can point ES-DE (or any frontend) straight at
`{Artwork Folder}/Artwork` with no export step.

```text
{Artwork Folder}/
├─ pfp-artwork-library.json        manifest — marks this folder as a PFP library
├─ Import/                         drop zone for other launchers' media (see below)
│   └─ {Launcher}/ …               an ES-DE downloaded_media tree
└─ Artwork/                        the library — ES-DE downloaded_media shape
    └─ {platformId}/               e.g. ps2, snes, psp
        ├─ covers/                 box art        →  {PortableName}.{ext}
        ├─ miximages/              hero
        ├─ fanart/                 background
        ├─ marquees/               logo
        ├─ screenshots/            screenshot
        ├─ titlescreens/           title screen
        ├─ physicalmedia/          cartridge / disc
        ├─ 3dboxes/                3D box
        ├─ manuals/                PDF manual
        ├─ videos/                 video
        └─ pfp/                    PFP-only namespace (skipped by scan & export)
            ├─ icon0/              144:80 ICON art
            ├─ icon1/              icon video snap
            ├─ originals/{kind}/   untouched pre-crop copies (lossless re-crop)
            └─ versions/{kind}/    one-previous backup ("Restore Previous")
```

The `pfp/` namespace holds PFP-only assets that are not ES-DE media types; `versions/` and
`originals/` are nested per `{kind}` so a game's box-art and icon backups (same filename) never
collide. Incoming **videos** are transcoded locally into a 60-second `icon1/` snap — the full-size
file is never stored.

#### How import works

1. **Drop** another launcher's media under `Import/{Launcher}/` in an ES-DE `downloaded_media`
   shape.
2. **Match** — PFP detects it by structure and links each file to a game in three passes: exact ROM
   filename → display title → tag-stripped title. Ambiguities are reviewed, never guessed.
3. **File** into `Artwork/{platform}/{mediaDir}/{PortableName}.{ext}`. Same-volume transfers move
   with zero bytes copied; otherwise they copy. Existing or locked artwork is never overwritten.

| ES-DE folder | Imports as (PFP kind) |
|---|---|
| `covers` | Box Art |
| `miximages` | Hero |
| `fanart` | Background |
| `marquees` | Logo |
| `screenshots` | Screenshot |
| `titlescreens` | Title Screen |
| `physicalmedia` | Physical Media |
| `3dboxes` | 3D Box |
| `manuals` | Manual (PDF) |
| `videos` | Video → transcoded to an ICON1 snap |
| `backcovers` | Recognized as library structure, not imported |

### 4.7 Icon display modes & video snaps

Every game tile can be drawn four ways — set a global default in *Settings ▸ Artwork ▸ Game Icon
Display*, per Memory Card, or per game via its **△** menu:

- **Custom Icon** — the PSP-authentic 144:80 ICON0 fill.
- **Box Art** — the game's cover at its natural aspect.
- **Physical Media** — the platform's cartridge/disc shot.
- **3D Box Art** — a rendered 3D box.

In **Custom Icon** mode, resting on a game plays its **video snap** inside the icon (muted, capped at
60 seconds, then fading back to the still) — the PSP's ICON1.PMF revived. It is battery-conscious:
one shared player, skipped under Battery Saver, low battery, or thermal pressure, and gated by an
**Animated Icons** master toggle in Settings.

### 4.8 Android apps & non-gaming categories

- **Add apps** to a section (App Store / Video / Music / Network / custom) via its **Add Apps** row.
- **App artwork** — apps show their launcher icon by default; give one custom art via
  **△ ▸ Edit App Details ▸ Icon** and it renders as a landscape tile. Apps stay tagged as apps, so
  they never appear in All Games.
- **Android games** — open the Android library card and choose **Find Games**; these are addable to
  collections but stay out of All Games.

### 4.9 The App Drawer

A bottom-right button (shown while using touch, or bound on a controller) opens the **App Drawer**:
all your apps with quick filters — **All Apps / Games / Emulators / Tools / Recently Used** —
switchable with **L1 / R1**.

### 4.10 Music, Video & Photo

Each media section is driven by **one or more root folders** you set in its Settings
screen (SAF folder picker — no storage permission):

- **Music** — scan folders, browse `[cover] title / artist`, and play in a full-screen player with a
  **background service** and media-notification controls. Create and manage **playlists**.
- **Video** — scanned libraries with thumbnails, Recently Watched / Favorites / Playlists, and a
  built-in player or your chosen external app.
- **Photo** — scanned albums, a fullscreen viewer (zoom, pan, rotate, L1/R1 paging), and
  **Set as Launcher Wallpaper** (EXIF-stripped; location data is never read).

Each section shows a single "＋ Add" getting-started row until a root has been added and scanned.

### 4.11 Categories

Categories are the horizontal bar. Manage them in *Settings ▸ Categories*:

- **Create** a category, choose a **content type** (Gaming = games & collections, Non-gaming =
  apps), and pick an **icon** from the image-based picker.
- **Rename, reorder** (move left/right), **hide/show,** or **delete** custom categories. Built-in
  categories are protected from deletion.

### 4.12 Themes & personalization

Everything lives in **Settings ▸ Themes**, built around one idea: *pick a background and one
color — the whole crossbar follows* (wave, gradient, cursor and icons all derive from it).

- **Color Scheme** — 12 PSP-style presets, previewed live on the real crossbar (including the
  month-cycling *Original*).
- **Icon Color** — one tint across every crossbar glyph: 8 curated swatches (*Default* is the
  native white) plus a **Custom** swatch that opens an HSV picker (Hue / Saturation /
  Brightness bars, adjustable by D-pad or touch). Game art, covers and app icons are never
  tinted.
- **New Theme from Photo** — any picture becomes the wallpaper; the theme color is auto-derived from
  its dominant hue.
- **Import PSP Theme (`.ptf`)** — convert an official PSP theme you own (wallpaper + derived color).
  CXMB firmware files are safely declined.
- **My Themes** — your saved themes as cards: apply, **Share** (`.pfptheme`), or Remove.

**Theme Studio** is a desktop companion (Windows / Linux / macOS) for authoring themes with a live
crossbar preview, an icon editor, wallpaper crop presets, crossbar alignment assist, and batch
`.ptf → .pfptheme` conversion. See [7.8](#78-the-theme-studio-desktop-app).

### 4.13 Custom XMB icons

> **Not in 1.2.1.** Ships in the next release.

Every glyph on the crossbar can be replaced with your own image — the category-bar icons, the menu
glyphs, and the per-console art on your Memory Cards. Around 55 theme slots plus one slot per
console.

Open **Settings ▸ Themes ▸ Custom Icons**. The editor runs *live over your real crossbar*, so you
are always looking at the actual result rather than a preview pane:

- Move with the D-pad to the icon you want to change, press **✕** to pick an image.
- **△** clears the selected slot back to whatever the theme (or the built-in art) provides.
- Changes apply instantly. Back out when you are happy.

| **Formats** | PNG, JPG, WEBP, BMP, HEIC, and animated **GIF** |
| **Size limit** | 8 MB per icon |
| **Animated GIFs** | 512 px or smaller, up to 120 frames, 10 seconds |

Animated icons only play on the row or column you are currently on, and stop entirely when battery
saver is on or a dialog is open — so a set of animated icons does not cost you frame rate while you
browse.

**Custom icons survive theme changes.** Applying a different theme swaps the theme's icons
underneath, but anything *you* picked stays on top. The order is always **your pick → the theme's
icon → the built-in art**. To get a theme's icon back, clear your pick for that slot with **△**.

**Saving your look** — *Settings ▸ Themes ▸ Save Current Look* bundles everything as it currently
draws (your picks already flattened in) into a shareable `.pfptheme`. Your screen-layout
adjustments are deliberately left out, since those are specific to your device.

### 4.14 Motion wallpapers

> **Not in 1.2.1.** Ships in the next release.

The crossbar background can be a looping video or animated image instead of a still.

Pick one from **Settings ▸ Themes ▸ Wallpaper** the same way you pick a photo — choose a video file
and PFP takes it from there, grabbing the first frame as a poster still at import.

| | |
|---|---|
| **Formats** | MP4, WebM, and animated GIF |
| **Resolution** | 1080p or smaller |
| **Length** | Up to 60 seconds |
| **File size** | Under 60 MB |
| **Frame rate** | 30 fps or lower recommended |

The clip pauses to its poster still whenever motion would be wasteful or distracting — during
video playback, behind fullscreen overlays, and on battery saver. It is fully released rather than
left paused in the background, so a motion wallpaper does not quietly drain your handheld while you
are doing something else.

Motion wallpapers can be authored into a shareable theme with the desktop **Theme Studio**, and
ride along inside the `.pfptheme` file.

### 4.15 Interface sounds & boot videos

> **Not in 1.2.1.** Ships in the next release.

**Settings ▸ Interface ▸ Sound** lets you replace PFP's interface audio and its startup sequence
with your own files. Each row has a **Preview** button (it plays even if menu sounds are muted) and
**Use Default** to revert.

**The seven sounds**

| Row | Plays when | Max length |
|---|---|---|
| **Navigation** | Moving the cursor around the crossbar | 0.5 s |
| **Back / Cancel** | Backing out of anything | 1 s |
| **Confirm / Apply** | Committing a choice — picking apps or games, importing an icon, saving a theme | 1 s |
| **Error / Invalid** | A refused launch or a rejected import | 1 s |
| **Launch Sound** | Starting an app (games boot silently — see GameBoot above) | 3 s |
| **Notification** | Reserved — not played in this build (it used to chime on background scans and backups) | 2 s |
| **Boot Sound** | The startup sequence | 10 s |

Audio can be MP3, WAV, OGG or M4A. Each sound's max length keeps playback snappy — SoundPool
holds a menu sound fully in memory, and the boot presentation must still end on time.

**Boot and GameBoot videos**

- **Boot Sequence** (*Settings ▸ Display ▸ Boot Sequence*) — one field: supply your own video (up
  to 10 seconds) and it replaces the PFP logo animation. Press **✕** or **○** to skip it. If your
  video has its own audio track that audio is used, and the Boot Sound row on the Sound screen
  steps aside.
- **GameBoot** — the short presentation that plays as a game launches. Built in, it is a
  five-second light sweep timed to the launch sound; supply your own clip (up to 10 seconds) and it
  replaces the whole thing, its own audio included. That audio is independent of your menu-sound
  setting, so muting menu sounds does not silence it. Switching GameBoot off gives a silent
  launch — no animation and no sound; games never fall back to the menu's launch chime. If the
  presentation has not finished in time the game launches anyway — GameBoot can never hold your
  game hostage.

Video can be MP4 or WebM, up to 25 MB.

Boot Video, GameBoot Video and every sound row work the same way and carry the same two controller
shortcuts on the focused row, bound to physical buttons so an X/Y swap cannot move them: the
**north** button (Y on Xbox/PlayStation pads, X on Nintendo) restores the PFP default, and the
**west** button (X on Xbox/PlayStation, Y on Nintendo) plays a preview.

Everything you assign here is included in **Backup & restore**.

### 4.16 Adjusting the layout for your screen

PFP scales itself to fit your device automatically, including near-square foldable inner displays.
To fine-tune it, open **Settings ▸ Display ▸ Adjust XMB Layout** — a live editor over the real
crossbar:

- **Scale** the whole interface, and **shift the crossbar** up/down and left/right.
- Drive it with the **D-Pad** (move), **L1 / R1** (scale), **Y** (reset), **A** (save), **B**
  (cancel) — or an on-screen **slider** panel.
- Each screen size keeps its **own** tuning, so a handheld and a foldable never share (and distort)
  one layout.

### 4.17 Backup & restore

*Settings ▸ Backup & Restore* writes a `.pfpbackup` archive (library + settings) into a folder you
pick, and restores from one. Because on-device cloud backup is disabled for privacy, this is how you
move your setup to a new device or recover after a reinstall. Restoring re-links your ROM/media
folders via *Library ▸ Root Access*.

### 4.18 Shiba Coins (achievements)

**Shiba Coins** turn achievements into a coin economy across your whole library. Enable it
under **Settings ▸ Shiba Coins** and connect one or more providers:

| Provider | What it tracks | You supply |
|---|---|---|
| **RetroAchievements** | Retro console games with RA sets | RA username + Web API key |
| **Steam** | Games on your own Steam account | SteamID64 (or vanity name) + Steam Web API key |
| **Local Steam** | Steam-emulated PC games run through Wine emulators | Steam Web API key (see [4.19](#419-tracking-local-steam-emulated-pc-games)) |

Each achievement earns a **bronze, silver, gold or platinum** coin by rarity; coins feed an
account-wide wallet with **levels and ranks** shown on the **Player Card**.

- **Player Card** — on the XMB and at the top of Settings ▸ Shiba Coins. Its menu holds
  **Sync All Coins**, which refreshes every tracked game in one pass. Confirm on the card
  opens the fullscreen **Player Status** view: level, rank and XP, Recent Achievements,
  your coin wallet, and your Rarest Achievement Unlocked — a recent unlock from a library
  game jumps straight to that game's coins screen.
- **Per-game coins screen** — from a game's Shiba Coins strip on Game Detail. Lists every
  achievement with its coin tier and unlock state; **X** cycles sorting, **Y** cycles the
  earned/unearned filter.
- **Auto-Match** — if a game is not linked yet, the coins screen offers one button that
  asks whether your copy is a legitimate Steam one: *Yes* matches it against Steam
  (embedded appid, SteamGridDB, title variants); *No* scans your windows game folders for
  Steam-emu data and links it as Local Steam. When nothing links, the screen tells you
  exactly what to fix.
- **Shiba Library** — a hub with an **All Tracked** view (filter by provider with **Y**,
  sort by Title / Progress / Console with **X**) and an **Untracked** view of games you
  could still link. Android games are excluded — they can never have achievements.

### 4.19 Tracking local (Steam-emulated) PC games

PFP can track achievements for Windows games run through Wine emulators (GameHub, Winlator,
GameNative and friends) whose bundled Steam emulator (GSE / Goldberg) records unlocks in local
files. Tracking is display-only: PFP reads what the game already wrote, joins it with the Steam
schema, and shows the result in Shiba Coins — run *Sync All Coins* from the Player Card to load
every tracked game.

> **Warning Note — back up your save files first.** This is opt-in behind
> *Settings ▸ Shiba Coins ▸ Track Local Steam Games (Emulated)*, and enabling it shows the
> same reminder. Turning it on lets a sync bring each emulator game up to the current setup:
> it rewrites the game's `steam_settings` config and replaces its `steam_api` DLL so unlocks
> can be recorded. A game you set up and played *before* this feature could lose access to its
> existing save data once the emulator starts reading from the new save location. Open your
> Windows emulator, back up the save files for those games, and only then enable the toggle and
> run *Sync All*.
>
> **Use your own Steam Web API key at your own risk.** This feature reads achievement data with
> the Steam Web API key you supply. Steam tracking is entirely optional — you do not have to
> enable it, and should only do so if you accept the risks that come with using your own key.

For a game folder to be tracked it must live under your windows library and carry the Steam-emu
config; achievement progress is read from the emu's own save redirect, or from a `saves` folder
you keep in the game directory:

```
<ROM Root>/windows/
├── import/                          ← exported launch files (.steam / .desktop / …)
└── <Game>/
    ├── steam_settings/
    │   └── steam_appid.txt          ← REQUIRED: marks the game and names its Steam appid
    ├── saves/
    │   └── [<appid>/]achievements.json   ← unlock progress (either level works)
    └── ...game files
```

To make the emulator RECORD unlocks into that folder (instead of its app-private global
location, which PFP cannot read), set the GSE save redirect once per game — create or edit
`steam_settings/configs.user.ini` and add:

```ini
[user::saves]
local_save_path=./saves
```

The path is relative to the folder holding the steam_api `.dll`/`.so`; with it set the emu
ignores its global save folder entirely (fully portable) and writes
`saves/<appid>/achievements.json` after each play session.

Notes:

- `steam_settings/steam_appid.txt` may sit a few folders deep (Unity games keep it under
  `<Game>_Data/Plugins/x86_64/`); PFP finds it automatically.
- PFP follows whatever `local_save_path` the game already uses first (e.g. `./GSE Saves`) —
  the `saves/` folder is the fallback convention for hand-arranged files.
- A game is tracked only once its save location exists (the redirect's target folder, or the
  `saves/` folder). Before any unlocks it tracks at 0%; a game with `steam_settings` but no
  save location at all stays untracked.
- Reading the schema needs your Steam Web API key (*Settings ▸ Shiba Coins*).
- Tracking is off until you enable *Track Local Steam Games (Emulated)* (see the Warning Note
  above); with it off, no discovery, generation, DLL swap, or syncing runs.
- A game folder with `steam_settings` but no `achievements.json` can't record unlocks —
  the emulator needs that schema file. When a PC scan finds one missing, PFP offers to bring
  the game up to the current emulator setup (per game: No / Yes / Yes to All for that scan):
  it writes the schema and stat files from the Steam Web API, sets the save redirect, and
  installs the bundled emulator over the game's original `steam_api` DLL (backed up alongside
  it). This is the step the Warning Note's backup protects against.

## 5. Permissions & privacy

PFP is a **local-first** launcher: your data stays on your device. There is no analytics, no
telemetry, and no account. PFP reaches the network only for the things you connect:
artwork/metadata scraping (SteamGridDB, ScreenScraper, TheGamesDB, IGDB) and achievement
data (RetroAchievements, Steam). Everything is HTTPS.

**What PFP stores, and how**
- **On-device only.** Your library, settings and artwork live in app storage. **Backup is disabled**
  (`allowBackup=false`), so nothing is uploaded or transferred automatically — use
  [Backup & restore](#417-backup--restore) to move devices.
- **Scraper API keys are encrypted at rest** with a hardware-backed Android Keystore key.
  On the rare devices where the Keystore is unavailable, a key you enter is stored
  unencrypted and the app tells you so at save time.
- **Network is HTTPS-only.** Cleartext is blocked, and release builds trust only the system
  certificate store.
- **Logs are redacted at write time** — credentials, tokens, account names and emails never reach
  disk.

**Why the broad permissions exist (and how they are minimized)**
- **ROM, media, theme and backup folders all use SAF** — you grant exactly the folders
  PFP reads, and no storage-all permission is ever requested. A handful of legacy raw-path
  libraries may still ask for media access on older Android versions.
- **Query installed apps** is required to *be* a launcher.
- **Usage access** is optional and only powers "Recently Used".

**Other apps can't silently change your library.** Legacy "install shortcut" broadcasts are
sanitized and require you to **confirm each one** before it appears.

---

## 6. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| Home button doesn't open PFP | Set it as default: *Android Settings ▸ Apps ▸ Default apps ▸ Home app*. |
| A console shows no games after adding ROMs | Scanning is manual — open the card's **△ ▸ Scan This Console**. |
| A game won't launch | Confirm the emulator app is installed; check the per-game/console emulator in **△** / Library Manager. |
| Disc/multi-file game not found | Open the game's console folder in a file manager and confirm the file is there; if the console uses a legacy raw-path library, re-grant its folder in *Settings ▸ Library*. |
| Artwork won't download | Add a SteamGridDB (or other) API key in *Settings ▸ Artwork* and check your connection. |
| Interface too big/small or off-center | Tune it in *Settings ▸ Display ▸ Adjust XMB Layout*. |

If something looks like a bug, grab the log from *Settings ▸ Logs ▸ Share* — it is redacted and safe
to send.

# For Developers

> This section is for building PFP from source. It assumes familiarity with Android development.

### 7.1 Tech stack

- **Language:** Kotlin `2.4.10`
- **UI:** Jetpack Compose (Compose BOM `2026.08.00`), MVVM + state hoisting
- **DI:** Hilt
- **Database:** Room — **schema v40**, hand-written migrations only (never destructive)
- **Settings:** DataStore Preferences
- **Networking:** Ktor (artwork / metadata scrapers)
- **Media:** Media3 (video snaps + in-app player)
- **Image loading:** Coil
- **Background work:** WorkManager + Android notifications
- **Serialization:** Kotlinx Serialization
- **Desktop companion:** Compose Multiplatform Desktop (`:studio`)
- **Testing:** JUnit 4 + MockK + Turbine
- **Build:** Gradle `9.7.1` (Kotlin DSL), AGP `9.4.0` (built-in Kotlin), KSP2

### 7.2 Prerequisites

- **Android Studio** — a recent stable release (Ladybug or newer recommended). Use the **bundled
  JetBrains Runtime (JBR 17/21)** as the IDE boot runtime.
- **JDK 17** for command-line Gradle (`JAVA_HOME` pointing at a JDK 17). The desktop `:studio`
  module targets a JVM 17 toolchain.
- **Android SDK 37** installed (compileSdk 37; targetSdk stays 35). Minimum supported device
  API is **29** (Android 10).

### 7.3 Get the code & open it in Android Studio

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd platform-selection-portal-launcher
```

1. In Android Studio choose **Open** and select the project root (the folder with
   `settings.gradle.kts`).
2. Let Gradle sync finish. Android Studio downloads the wrapper (`9.7.1`) and the declared
   plugins/dependencies automatically.
3. If prompted, install the matching **Android SDK 37**, **NDK,** and **CMake** from the SDK
   Manager.

### 7.4 Build variants

There are no product flavors — one app, two build types: `debug` (`.debug` application-id suffix)
and `release` (R8 + signing). Switch the active one in the **Build Variants** tool window.

### 7.5 Run & debug from Android Studio

1. Pick your device/emulator and press **Run** (or **Debug**).

### 7.6 Release signing

Release builds are signed from a **gitignored** `keystore.properties` at the repo root. Without it,
release builds still assemble but stay **unsigned**.

```properties
# keystore.properties (do not commit)
storeFile=/absolute/path/to/release.keystore
storePassword=…
keyAlias=…
keyPassword=…
```

### 7.7 Command-line builds & the `dist` task

```bash
# Debug APK
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug

# Release APK; signed if keystore.properties is present
./gradlew :app:assembleRelease

# Unit tests
./gradlew test
```

**One command for everything shippable:**

```bash
./gradlew dist
```

`dist` builds the release APK and the Theme Studio installer for the current OS and
collects them, cleanly named, into the gitignored **`dist/`** folder:

```
dist/
├── PSPLauncher-<version>.apk
└── PlayField-Theme-Studio-<version>.msi   (or .dmg / .deb per OS)
```

Every individual release build also finalizes a copy into `dist/`.

### 7.8 The Theme Studio desktop app

`:studio` is a Compose Multiplatform Desktop app that shares `:core:theme-kit` with the launcher
(and must never grow an Android dependency).

```bash
# Run it
./gradlew :studio:run          # or run-theme-studio.bat on Windows

# Package a native installer for the current OS (MSI / DMG / DEB)
./gradlew :studio:packageReleaseDistributionForCurrentOS
```

### 7.9 Module structure

Strict dependency direction: **features → core**; `app` wires everything via Hilt.

```
app/                      MainActivity (HOME launcher), PFPApplication, Hilt app module
studio/                   Theme Studio — Compose Desktop companion (Win/Linux/macOS)
core/
  theme-kit/              Pure-JVM theme core shared with Theme Studio: PTF/BMP/GIM/LZR parsers,
                          .pfptheme codec, color cascade, icon-slot registry, layout spec + adjust,
                          and the shared limits (UiMediaLimits, MotionLimits, IconGifSupport)
  core-archive/           Pure-JVM bounded ZIP ingestion shared by themes, backup and the codec
  core-common/            Shared utilities and extensions
  core-domain/            Domain models, repository interfaces
  core-data/              Room DB (v41), DAOs, DataStore, repository impls, migrations,
                          and the user-asset stores (CustomIconStore, UiMediaStore, PfpThemeStore)
  core-navigation/        Pure navigation logic, no Android dependency — NavigationEngine, gridMove
  core-ui/                PFPTheme/PFPColors, WaveStyle, PortalIcon, category-icon catalog,
                          motion-wallpaper surfaces, MenuSoundPlayer
feature/
  feature-xmb/            Crossbar shell, XMBViewModel, game/app detail, Artwork Studio, boot
  feature-library/        ROM scanner, rescan triggers, disc-image resolver, platform map
  feature-launcher/       Emulator detection, the launch-resolution ladder, LaunchDispatcher
  feature-artwork/        Scraper clients, portable artwork library, ES-DE import/export
  feature-achievements/   Shiba Coins: RA / Steam / Local Steam providers, wallet, sync
  feature-themes/         Theme loader/repository, built-in themes
  feature-settings/       Settings screens + ViewModels
  feature-appbar/         App drawer, app→category classification, filters
  feature-backup/         BackupManager, backup/restore workers
```

See **[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)** for data-flow, launch-pipeline, and state detail.

### 7.10 Testing

```bash
./gradlew test                     # all unit tests
./gradlew :feature:feature-xmb:test  # a single module
```

Unit tests use JUnit 4 + MockK + Turbine; `:core:theme-kit` additionally ships golden tests against
Sony's own example PSP themes.

## 8. Credits

### Interface design — inspired by Sony's XMB
The look and feel is inspired by the **XMB (XrossMediaBar)**, the interface Sony created for the
PlayStation Portable, PlayStation 3 and other devices. The crossbar layout, flowing wave
background, navigation model and options-menu behaviour are homages to Sony's original design.

**"XrossMediaBar", "XMB", "PSP", "PlayStation" and related marks are trademarks of Sony Interactive
Entertainment Inc.** PSPLauncher is an independent, non-commercial fan project. It is **not
affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Sony**, and ships none of Sony's code, firmware,
fonts or audio. The bundled UI artwork comes from the community *XMB Menu for ES-DE* theme (see
below) and remains the property of its respective authors; the menu sounds are original to this
project.

**On the name.** *PFP* is a deliberate double entendre — *PSPLauncher* as the product name,
and the affectionate shorthand from anime and gaming communities. The trademarks above cover the
*names* "XMB" and "Cross Media Bar", not the visual style itself, which is not protectable as trade
dress in a non-competing product category. That reading is why the homage is drawn as openly as it
is, while the marks themselves are left alone.

### App icon & logo
The PSPLauncher **app icon and logo** were created by **johakovi**
([u/silverloc96](https://www.reddit.com/user/silverloc96) on Reddit), who generously volunteered
their time to make them. The work is amazing — please go check out their work.

### System & console artwork
The system, console and category icons come from the
**[XMB Menu for ES-DE](https://github.com/anthonycaccese/xmb-menu-es-de)** theme — a community
recreation of the PSP's crossbar interface for ES-DE.

**All rights to this artwork belong to its creators — [Anthony Caccese](https://github.com/anthonycaccese),
building on the original work by InitialDin.** Used here with gratitude; it remains the property of
its respective authors.

- Project: XMB Menu for ES-DE · Authors: Anthony Caccese · InitialDin
- Source: https://github.com/anthonycaccese/xmb-menu-es-de
- Used for: category-bar icons, per-console system icons, the physical-media (cartridge) icon set

### Controller button icons
Every on-screen button prompt — the PlayStation, Xbox and Nintendo face buttons, D-pads,
bumpers, triggers, sticks and system buttons — is drawn from **Zacksly's** button icon packs.

- Author: **Zacksly** · Website: https://zacksly.itch.io · Support: https://www.patreon.com/zacksly
- Packs: *PS5 Button Icons and Controls*, *Xbox Series Button Icons and Controls*,
  *Switch 2 Button Icons and Controls* (all "Buttons Solid / White / 128w")
- License: **CC BY 3.0** — http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/
- Used for: `ctl_ps_*`, `ctl_xb_*`, `ctl_ns_*` in `core-ui` — the glyphs behind every
  `ControllerPrompt`, resolved to the user's chosen controller type
- **Unmodified.** The bundled PNGs are byte-identical to the pack originals; only the file
  names were changed to Android resource names, and only the needed subset is included.

### Menu sounds
The seven bundled **sound effects** — navigation, back, confirm, error, launch, notification and
the boot sound — are **original, authored for this project**. They aim for the *feel* of the XMB
without being derived from it: each one is cross-correlated against reference material and has to
score below a fixed similarity threshold to ship. No Sony firmware audio is bundled, and none is
committed to this repository.

Earlier builds bundled menu sounds from the community *XMB Menu for ES-DE* theme; those were
replaced by the original set. You can replace any of the seven with your own audio — see
[4.15](#415-interface-sounds--boot-videos).

### Game artwork & metadata
Fetched at the user's request from third-party providers and remaining the property of their owners:
- **SteamGridDB** — community artwork (grids, heroes, logos, icons)
- **IGDB** and **TheGamesDB** — optional metadata / artwork sources

### Achievement data (Shiba Coins)
- **RetroAchievements** — community-made achievement sets and unlock data for retro games,
  fetched via the official RetroAchievements Web API and the official
  [api-kotlin](https://github.com/RetroAchievements/api-kotlin) client. Achievement sets are
  the work of the RetroAchievements community. https://retroachievements.org
- **Steam** — achievement schemas and unlock data are fetched from the **Steam Web API**
  using the user's own API key. **Powered by Steam.** Steam and the Steam logo are
  trademarks and/or registered trademarks of **Valve Corporation**. PSPLauncher is
  not affiliated with or endorsed by Valve. https://steampowered.com

### Goldberg Steam Emulator (gbe_fork)
Local achievement tracking for Steam-emulated PC games ([4.19](#419-tracking-local-steam-emulated-pc-games))
bundles the **Goldberg Steam Emulator** — specifically **gbe_fork**, the community fork
maintained by **Detanup01** and contributors, building on the original **Goldberg Emulator**
by **Mr. Goldberg**.

- Project: [gbe_fork](https://github.com/Detanup01/gbe_fork) · Original:

- License: **GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0 (LGPL-3.0)** —
  [full text](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html)
- What PFP ships: an **unmodified** build of the emulator's `steam_api64.dll`, bundled as an
  app asset and installed into a game folder only when you opt in and confirm (see the
  Warning Note in [4.19](#419-tracking-local-steam-emulated-pc-games)). The original DLL is
  always backed up alongside, so the emulator build can be freely replaced with your own —
  as the LGPL requires. The complete corresponding source code is available from the
  project links above.
